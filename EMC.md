## Lesson 1: The Historical Origins of Democracy

### The Case of Roman Tables and Roman Law

1.  Explain how the Rroman tables were originally created and established as law
-   Originated from a “struggle between upper and lower class” (patricians and plebeians) = disunity and inequality between plebeians and patrician rights
-   So the “first Decemviri” created 12 laws that were then be reviewed by every citizen and brought up on public discussion
2.  Explain how the executive judicial and legislative powers are organized
-   Judicial power is taken under by judges who themselves can receive death sentence in case of “bribe”, “treason” or “putting any man to death unconvicted”
-   Law is above any executive power.
3.  Can the Rroman tables be considered as democratic (democracy = a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.)
In some ways it is democratic as each “table” came under review by every citizen (not taking into account that only a small percentage of people living in Rome were citizens), however, certain tables do not really fit to democratic standards (table IV /VIII / etc.). Furthermore, Table XI divides the Rroman society by preventing non-citizens to marry citizens. This feeds into a form of elitism; and inbreeding. The fact that this table is after Table X  is based on sanitary reasons may mean that this division between citizens and non-citizens was based on eugenics and pseudo-scientific motivation. However it wasn't enforced. 

This constitution was made to establish peace and to put an end to class tensions. This social contract was elaborated collectively, so it would be recognized by all citizens. Roman society was far more complicated because mixing and transfer in classes was extremely common. Classes were all defined as being citizens and were collectively opposed to barbarians. 

### Education
Questions:

1. What is the purpose of education and educators, according to Jean Jaurès ?
2. What are the qualities that one expected from educators ? What outcomes one expected from students
3. What difficulties are currently impairing eductors and students from achieving this vision ?

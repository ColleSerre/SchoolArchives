## Lesson 1: The Historical Origins of Democracy

### The Case of Roman Tables and Roman Law

1.  Explain how the roman tables were originally created and established as law
-   Originated from a “struggle between upper and lower class” = disunity and inequality between plebeians and patrician rights
-   So the “first Decemviri” created 12 laws that were then be reviewed by every citizen and brought up on public discussion
2.  Explain how the executive judicial and legislative powers are organized
-   Judicial power is taken under by judges who themselves can receive death sentence in case of “bribe”, “treason” or “putting any man to death unconvicted”
-   Law is above any executive power.
3.  Can the roman tables be considered as democratic (democracy = a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.)
In some ways it is democratic as each “table” came under review by every citizen (not taking into account that only a small percentage of people living in Rome were citizens), however, certain tables do not really fit to democratic standards (table IV /VIII / etc.). Fu

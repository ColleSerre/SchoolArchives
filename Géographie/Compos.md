## Rural Spaces - changing spaces

* Rural exodus in the global North is **finished** since the end of the 20th century ; in the global South, it's still going on
* Rural population has stabilizsed after having dropped and has even, in some countries like Austria, *increased*.
* Not all rural spaces are created equal. The most attractive ones are close to cities, main roads and landmarks. This is because many city-workers **cannot afford** to live in the city but need to be at a reasonable **commuting** distance from their place of work.
* In the North, a rural area is defined by its **low population density and high natural elements count and a predominance of agriculture in the local economy**. In the South however, rural spaces are much more populated (sometimes it can reach **1000 hab/km^2 in India or China**). In *Africa*, due to demographic transition (when a population transitions from a demographic regime characterised by a high death rate and a high birth rate to a new regime characterised by a lower death rate and a lower birth rate), which is was caused by the industrial development of the continent, some rural spaces have seen their population **multiplied by 10 in the last 50 years** (especially in *Great Lakes Africa*)
* Since the end of the 20th century, **urban sprawl** and **modernisation** have caused agriculture in rural spaces to play a less important role in the local economy.
* 45% of the world population lives in rural spaces
* Some countries in the North are witnessing rural decline, less people in rural spaces and less economical activity in rural spaces.
* Even though rural spaces have gone through modernisation, there still are remote rural areas that are far from crucial infrastructures like high-speed internet and are far away from doctors, universities. The population in these areas is, most of the time, old or do not have any means of transportation. 

## Rural economy

* Rural spaces rely heavily on agriculture
* In the South, ancient agricultural structures are still in activity. For example, in South America: *microfundios* (small holdings that are maintained by individuals, food crops) and *latifundios* (holdings that have thousands of employees, and produce food to export it)
* In the North, most holdings do intensive farming but some Neocountry people have created small farms that value quality and not quantity.

## Conflicts of use - impact of intensive agriculture

* 2,4 Million km^2 have been completely destroyed between 1990 and 2015.
* Intensive farming can have a negative impact on soil, farmers and consumers. Animal digestion, manure, use of fossil fuel and fertilisers, these make agriculture responsible for 25% of greenhouse gasses.
* Rural spaces will be the first environments to be heavily impacted by climate change as floods, droughts and cyclones will be more and more frequent.

## Conflicts of use & globalisation

* **Land grabbing** has increased ever since the 2008 economic crisis. Big private or public investors bargain with poor southern states in Asia and Africa. This is detrimental to the locals and sometimes the environment. The fait of locals is in the hands of the government which is interested by profit which can create tensions (Ethiopia 2016, federalisation of the country but centralisation of the power in the hands of the Tigray who represent 6% of the population).
* In North and South, states encourage *agribusiness*, producing to export. This is detrimental to small holdings. For example, in the US: the government funds large holdings to help conquer foreign markets (this generated 12 billion dollars in 2018). This makes small holdings from poor countries poorer.

## Conflict of use at a local scale

* Most tensions are in suburban are	as because they are multifunctional. Industries, farmers, tourism operators don't use the ressources of these rural spaces in the same way. For example, a river can be used to cool a factory, to irrigate crops or for rafting but not all at the same time. 
* There can also be tension between locals and tourists (residential vs recreational functions)
* Some 
* Due to urban sprawl, suburban properties have gained value and the price of ownership is preventing young farmers from settling in suburban area. For example, in the Nil Valley: Agricultural lands diminish due to the artificialisation of soil. 
* Making an area part of the UNESCO heritage, and therefore protecting it, is a difficult task for locals. UNESCO only deals with governments, therefore, if the government believes that money should prevail locals cannot do anything against that (in a case of land grabbing for example)

| Conflicts of use at a global scale | Conflicts of use at a local scale |
|---|---|
|Environmental concerns| Multi-functionality (many different economical players use suburban areas)|
|Government encouraging agro-business which is detrimental to small holdings|Property prices increase|
|Land grabbing|Making an area part of the UNESCO heritage|

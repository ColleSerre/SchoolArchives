## Oil

Russia is the second larges oil exporting country in the world. The biggest Russian companies are Rosneft and Lukoil, they mostly produce oil in West Siberia which was a major change for the region. It also means that Siberia is the most important geographical asset for Russia. 
Siberia was also used for gulags during the Soviet Union, and has been providing two thirds of Russia's oil since the 1970s. The fall of the Soviet Union has led to a drop in petroleum output but the country has since recovered, thanks to the development and use of new technology and privatization and the increase in oil use around the world. This sector is expected to continue to grow as more oil is to be found in Russian Antarctica and oil consumption is still high worldwide.

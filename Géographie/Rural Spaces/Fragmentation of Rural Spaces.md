# Rural Spaces

---

*Case studies*: The Amazon rainforest and Texas

### Definitions:

* Rural Spaces: 

* *Hypothesis:* A space that isn't a city. Is most of the time in a preserved natural environment. Has poor access to modern comforts (internet access, electricity). Rural spaces differ from urban areas by having a lower population density. Rural areas were probably defined by cities, the industrial advances took place in the cities which further segregated rural spaces from the cities. Lower cost of living but less infrastructures. 

* Different types of rural spaces (ex: a forest in France != a forest in Brazil)

 Handbook questions (page 3):

1. Since the definition of urban area varies greatly from country to country and even in one country, the definition of a rural space also varies. A rural space in Europe maybe won't be used in the same way as a Russian rural space. There are also different types of rural spaces ; the limits between rural and urban areas are very blurred. 

2. Some of the uses of rural spaces are:
   
   * Agriculture
   - Preserving wildlife
   
   - Residential (quieter, less crowded => **nouveaux ruraux**)
   
   - Tourism (Parks, local foods)
   
   - Extraction of resources (gas, oil, wood, minerals/metals, coal)

3. 
   
   1. Agriculture, which was the main purpose of rural spaces, is getting more and more globalized. We no longer eat food that comes from our country if we don't expressly try to. Rural spaces are therefore losing their value and they and their governments need to reimagine their way of using these resources.
   
   2. Due to the lack of jobs in the rural areas, people have relocated to the already-saturated city in hopes to find one.
   
   3. Urban people who already have a job and a family are now moving out of the city to find better public schools and cheaper housing as well as improving their quality of life (less pollution, less noise, less people, less stress).
   
   4. Traditional definitions tend to overlook the advantages of rural spaces

4.  Rural spaces are now defined in regards with social profile and social practices (job location, relationship with rural spaces (do you live there or are you only a worker there)).
   
St-Denis case study ([Remonter le temps St-Denis](https://remonterletemps.ign.fr/comparer/basic?x=2.357592&y=48.928919&z=14&layer1=ORTHOIMAGERY.ORTHOPHOTOS&layer2=GEOGRAPHICALGRIDSYSTEMS.ETATMAJOR40&mode=doubleMap))

St-Denis has expanded since the 19th century (Urbanization ; urban sprawl), highways have been built (development of transportation networks) and the fields surrounding the east of the city have been replaced by woods (agricultural decline).

### Positive and negative effect of urbanization

|Positive|Negative|
|--|--|
|More infrastructures/services => increased employment rate|Less Agriculture => drop in food production => food prices increase|
|Gentrification => more wealthy consumers for local shops|Possible growing reliance on tourism => unstable demand for labor force|
||Increased housing prices and increased population|
||Increased pollution (air, CO2, plastic, noise)|
||Gentrification|
||More pressure on water resources|


Urbanization has different effects on rural spaces. I will be discussing the positive effects. Urbanization has positive effects on rural spaces. It is crucial for rural spaces to reinvent themselves to benefit of all the productivity benefits that our age brings. Rural spaces have less internet access and cellular connectivity which reduces productivity for local companies and makes it impossible for people to work from home.

Urbanization also generates more public infrastructures and services for the city dwellers to enjoy. These infrastructures bring more security, health and jobs to the inhabitants. Rural areas don't have as many good hospitals or as modern schools as urbanized areas.

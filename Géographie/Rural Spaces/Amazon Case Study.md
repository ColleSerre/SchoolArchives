# Rural Spaces: The Amazonian Road Decision

Brazil has gotten richer due to the increased use of the Amazon rain-forest, the biggest forest in the world, for agriculture. Brazil's biggest exports are chicken, beef, soybeans, maize and pork. Brazil has also drastically increased their palm oil production to 490 MT per year. Although Brazil's GDP has increased in the past 10 years, the GDP per capita is still very low meaning that people are still poor. These changes and increase in deforestation are mostly due to Jair Bolsonaro government.

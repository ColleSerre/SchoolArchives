Explain their change of fortunes and their link with the passengers on the sunken ship:

* 12 years ago Prospero was the Duke of Milan
* Miranda was his only child and heir and a princess
* Prospero's brother (Antonio) manipulated the people of Milan to reject Prospero, the usurping Duke of Milan

Antonio could have realized that the region needed to be ruled while Prospero was busy studying occult arts and took the job as Duke of Milan. 

King Alonso and Antonio plotted against Prospero

Act III Scene 1 Quotation quest:

1. Ferdinand is talking about Miranda and doesn't seem to mind that his task is difficult (he is enamoured)
2. Ferdinand "some thousand of these logs": can't keep track of his work/doesn't feel like it's a lot because of his love 
3. Miranda sounds apologetic for the treatment Ferdinand is getting from her father Prospero
4. A contemporary interpretation would be that Prospero is making fun of Miranda when he could be threatened by his daughter's feelings for Ferdinand (who he still believes is a spy)
5. Ferdinand
6. Miranda
7. Prospero aside, why is he saying this aside ? (secretly wanting prospero and miranda to be in love, why would he hide it ?)
8. Ferdinand puts aside his kingdom as a proof of love
9. Miranda
10. Prospero

Explain their change of fortunes and their link with the passengers on the sunken ship:

* 12 years ago Prospero was the Duke of Milan
* Miranda was his only child and heir and a princess
* Prospero's brother (Antonio) manipulated the people of Milan to reject Prospero, the usurping Duke of Milan

Antonio could have realized that the region needed to be ruled while Prospero was busy studying occult arts and took the job as Duke of Milan. 

King Alonso and Antonio plotted against Prospero

Activity page 14:

a. I, thus neglected worldly ends
b. all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind
c. With all that which, but by being so retired, O'er-prized all popular rate
d. in my false brother awaked an evil nature
e. A falsehood, in its contrary as great as my trust was- which had indeed no limit, a confidence sans bound.
f. Not only what my revenue yielded, but what my power might else exact
g. To credit his own lie - he did believe he was indeed Duke
h. Hence his ambition growing
i. To have no screen between this part he played
j. Me, poor man, my library was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable
k. So dry he was for sway - wi'th' King of Naples to give him annual tribute, do him homage, subject his coronet to his crown, and bend the dukedom yet unbowed

Act III Scene 1 Quotation quest:

1. Ferdinand is talking about Miranda and doesn't seem to mind that his task is difficult (he is enamoured)
2. Ferdinand "some thousand of these logs": can't keep track of his work/doesn't feel like it's a lot because of his love (usually Caliban's job, hyperbole) 
3. Miranda sounds apologetic for the treatment Ferdinand is getting from her father Prospero
4. A contemporary interpretation would be that Prospero is making fun of Miranda when he could be threatened by his daughter's feelings for Ferdinand (who he still believes is a spy). His character represents wisdom and power, love would blind in his opinion. He may think she might be manipulated by Ferdinand and the situation he started could get out of hand.
5. Ferdinand, talking about Miranda. Flattering her, admiration, incomparable to 
6. Miranda
7. Prospero aside, why is he saying this aside ? (secretly wanting prospero and miranda to be in love, why would he hide it ?)
8. Ferdinand puts aside his kingdom as a proof of love
9. Miranda
10. Prospero

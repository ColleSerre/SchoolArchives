# Symbols and Motifs - The Handmaid's tale

Notes from vide (available on Drive):
* Doubles are a recurring theme: the handmaids have to walk in couples, Luke and Offred, Nick and Offred, Serena and the commander, there are two Ofglens, the Nazi woman and the Nazi officer. When Ofglen is replaced, it reminds Offred that she too is replaceable.
* The colour red has a lot of references: blood, the colour of the handmaid's dresses, fertility and pregnancy, the flag of Gilead, seduction

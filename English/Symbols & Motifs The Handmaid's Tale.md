# Symbols and Motifs - The Handmaid's tale

Notes from vide (available on Drive):
* Doubles are a recurring theme: the handmaids have to walk in couples, Luke and Offred, Nick and Offred, Serena and the commander, there are two Ofglens, the Nazi woman and the Nazi officer. When Ofglen is replaced, it reminds Offred that she too is replaceable.
* The colour red has a lot of references: blood, the colour of the handmaid's dresses, fertility and pregnancy, the flag of Gilead, seduction. In the poem *A Red Shirt*, Margaret Atwood refers to the many meanings of the colour red: anger, sacrifice, death, passion, war. They are defined by their habits which resemble that of nuns. This is ironic because they are defined by their place in a regime built on blood.
* Other colours:
	* Black = commander's costume, fear, authority, autocracy (priests wear black)
	* Blue = colour of the wives, symbolic of the Virgin Mary
	* Khaki = Aunts, military colour, No femininity, reference to Nazi 'brownshirts'
* Eyes: A society in which everything is visible to an unknown, hostile authority is sometimes known as panoptic. Literally this means eyes are everywhere. This idea of not being able to escape observation is a common feature in dystopian fiction, most famously explored in Orwell's 1984 where big brother is always watching you. Offred has a plaster eye in her room.
* Mirrors:
	* Handmaids are not allowed to see their reflection in mirrors because vanity is a deadly sin. Links to the removal of other 'dangerous' objects. A symbol of control
	* Can be formed into weapons (much like books - another proscribed object)
	* Links to removal of possession of their bodies
* Flowers
	* Represe

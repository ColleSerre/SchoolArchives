# Medea Agony Aunt


### Medea to aunt

Dear agony aunt, 

My heart and trust have been destroyed. My home is no longer mine, I have the honor of the women of Kerameikos and my once beloved children are the living remembrance of my pain. My husband Jason has been unfaithful. The ungrateful pig has wed the king of Corinth's daughter! Ô ! Dear agony aunt how may I heal from such a wound? I have killed both father and brother by love for Jason, left my country for Jason and have struggled to earn the Corinthian's welcome. To think that I have never failed him and gave my heart an life to be spat at and threatened to be banned from the city that I used to call home. Yes agony aunt, you have read me right! Creon, Jason's godfather and king of Corinth, will have me killed if I'm not out of his city's walls by tomorrow's rising sun.

What am I to do my cherished agony aunt ? Tomorrow I will be homeless and countryless. Who would welcome a woman who is known for practicing the dark arts, committing both parricide and fratricide ? I need your help agony aunt.

You are my only hope.

Medea

### Aunt to Medea

Dear Medea,

I have read your letter with great care and attention. You are going through some very difficult times my poor Medea but I am sure that you will find peace in the future but in the meantime I have some wisdom to share with you. First of all, do not feel any resentment or hate towards your children, they are the only living beings that are innocent in this tragic episode of your life. I use the word episode to remind you that this is all temporary and that the world is vast enough for you and Jason to share. I recommend, better yet I command you, to leave Corinth. You must not make a show out of your sorrow and leave with your head held high. As to your housing situation, do not fear for that for you seem like a very resourceful and intelligent woman, you will find a way just like you always do. I want you to remember that this will all end and that you will come out even stronger than you already are.

My prayers go to you Medea

Your agony aunt

## Characters

### Medea
Protagonist of the play, is from Colchis which was considered a territory of barbarians. A sorceress and a princess, she used her powers to help Jason secure the Golden Fleece and fell in love with him. She fled her country and family, killed her brother and father for him. Jason and Medea were both exiled as murderers so they settled in Corinth. She has two children and is well known in the city. She kills her kids and flies off on a golden chariot. She also kills the king of Corinth (father of Jason's bride) and Jason's bride (Glauce).

### Jason
Can be considered the villain, former adventurer, abandoned Medea (his wife) to marry Glauce. He married Glauce to further his status in the city of Corinth. This fuelled Medea's revenge. Jason is tactless and only serves his interests and fails to rationalise his actions which makes him a weak and unsympathetic character.

### Children
Used by Medea to give a poisoned dress and cursed coronet to Glauce. Their death is the greatest element of pathos in the play.

### Chorus
Composed only of the women of Corinth, they comment the action although they sometimes engage in dialog with characters (to persuade Medea not to kill her children). 

### Creon
Banishes Medea from the city, is a minor character. Dies by trying to hold his daughter one last time before she'll die. This is one of the play's most dramatic moments.

### Glauce
Creon's young and beautiful princess, Jason abandoned Medea for her. She accepted Medea's poisoned dress and coronet which made her the first murder of the play. `

### Aegeus
King of Athens, passed through Corinth after visiting the Oracle at Delphi to cure his sterility. Medea offers him some fertility pills in exchange for sanctuary in Athens. IS A TURNING POINT IN THE PLAY: Medea goes from being a passive victim to an active aggressor. 

## Themes

### Truth vs Rethoric
The tragedy of *Medea* is full of deceitful, true-seeming monologues (Jason's when he tries to convince Jason of giving Glauce a gift to kill her). "For myself I do not mind if I go into exile, It is the children being in trouble that I mind".

### The Roles of Men and Women
The events of *Medea* take place in a male-dominated society, a society that allows Jason and Creon to casually and brutally shunt Medea aside. The play is an exploration of the roles of men and women, both actual and ideal, but it is not necessarily an argument for sexual equality. Creon and Jason find Medea's cleverness more dangerous and frightening because she is a woman. "A sharp tempered woman..." Creon says, "Is easier to deal with than the clever type who holds her tongue." "Suppose your man gives honours to another woman's bed," it says. "It often happens. Don't be hurt. God will be your friend in this".
Everyone, it seems, has a different opinion on what a good woman or a good man is and does. Jason says it would be better if men "got their children in some other way" and women didn't exist at all. "Then life would have been good." Medea weighs in on this: "We women are the most unfortunate creatures."

### Medea the inhumane
Jason isn't a regular man/tragic hero (he's childish) and Medea isn't a regular woman (she's resilient and fierce). Their actions are against the natural order of things. When they act in natural ways, it's shocking to the original Greek audience. Medea gives an "unnatural" feeling because she's from a non-greek country place and isn't behaving like a woman is expected to.

### Duty
Everyone fails their duties in this tragedy. Jason fails as a husband and to protect Glauce, Medea fails as a mother, Creon fails as a king and father. This depicts Glauce and the children as being some of the most innocent prominent characters in the play, they are also casualties, this makes Medea seem monstrous.

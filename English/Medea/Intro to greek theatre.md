# The Epidaurus theatre

stage = skene
Prologue => gives context necessary to the play's understanding
Parodos => first song by the chorus
Stasimon => musical interlude,, sung by chorus
Exodos => last song by chorus
*Largest* of surviving ancient theatre
Greeks considered music and theatre to have healing properties (this theatre was built next to a healing center)
55 rows of seats, 14000 spectators in the theatron
Perfect acoustics thanks to *resonators* (a coin falling in the center could be heard in the seats far behind)
Painted wall behind the actors to represent the scenery
You can still watch theatre at the Epidaurus
Limestone seats that faced the sunrises

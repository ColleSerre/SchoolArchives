## Difference between essay and commentary

A commentary only is about the text, an essay is about a larger question. 

## Background/Introduction to Death of a Salesman - By Arthur Miller ([Powerpoint presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZorcoqKVx-NkqHyllmcbU-g9nT-xdfYu/view))
* 1915-2005
* Published his first play while he was in college
* Married at one point to Marilyn Monroe
* Went to prison for contempt of court
* Wrote *The Crucible*, an allegorical play in which he likened the situation with the House of Un-American Activities Committee to the witch-hunt in Salem
* Wrote *Death of a Salesman*, which was viewed as an attack on the American Dream if achieving wealth and success without regard for principle

### Themes:
**Capitalism**: When private companies control a countries production
**The American Dream**: A set of ideals in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work.

### Historical context:
During the postwar boom of 1948, most Americans were optimistic about a renewed version of the American Dream: striking it rich in some commercial venture, then moving to a house with a yard in a peaceful suburban neighbourhood where they could raise children and commute to work in their new automobile. 

## Characters:

### Willy Loman 
* His mind wonders, he has hallucinations
* He's nostalgic, wants his old life back (it all went south when Biff flunked math)
* A flute music plays when Willy thinks and talks to Ben (makes him think of his father). He talks to Ben when he feels alone
* **Is in an emotional turmoil**
* His mind keeps looking back to the path because he's exhausted in his present life, his life used to be easier, more understandable. 
* he's upset about his job and wants to work in New York to travel less but his boss isn't understanding and makes him go all the way to Boston. He's paid on commission and isn't making as much money as before because his sales are down. 
* Thinks that Biff is "a lazy bum".
* His name is *lone man* and Dave was named *single man* which means that all salesman are lonely men.
* Is anxious about Biff not being settled down
* Thinks success is living in a man-made environment but ends up planting seeds to feel closer to nature (Biff was right in a  way) 

### Linda
* Unconditionally loves Will but thinks he's too tired and needs some rest
* Knows Willy wants to kill himself, told biff about the rubber pipe but was too scared to act (if she takes the pipe away, he'll feel humiliated)
* Her life revolves around Willy and making him happy
* Is anxious about Biff not being settled down

### Biff
* Feels like he didn't accomplish anything in life
* Knows he should be settled but he prefers the outdoors and hasn't found a job to settle down for.
* Used to be successful with women but has lost his confidence
* Has returned home to find a job in the city
* Knows Willy is anxious about him not being settled down
* Doesn't go well with Willy, they both lose their temper fast
* Thinks a man should spend his life in the outdoors
* Resents Willy, but it is unclear until the end of the play

### Happy
* Happy is one of the most unhappy characters in the play ("are you happy? - Hell no!") -> ironic
* Works in a store but feels like he could do better
* Suspects that, like his boss, he'll never be able to be happy in a new house/will always be longing for something else to buy (things it takes more than materialistic goods to be happy in life)
* Very close with Biff (they're brothers)
* Is also in an emotional turmoil because he's still lonely despite all of his possessions and women. 

## Themes

* Pride (like Medea)
* Visions of America
* Dreams, Hopes and plans
* Illusions vs reality (the illusion that success is quantifiable, that they are happy (in the hallucinations) and that success is pending, that Biff's resentment isn't linked to his 
* Lies and deceit
* Success (failed as an employee, father, husband and as an American (failed the American Dream))
* Respect and Reputation
* Appearances
* Abandonment
* Freedom and confinement
* Betrayal (Willy's affair, Willy being fired after years of loyalty, Willy's suicide)

## Symbols

* Seeds (Willy's final attempt to raise something well, couldn't raise his boys without his own father, couldn't raise his crops without sunlight)
* Flute
* Stockings (During WW2, stockings were rare, therefore, something he can't get for his wife)
* Distant lands (ben asks him to go to Alaska and finds success in Africa -> Ben = what Willy aspired to ; Biff dreams of owning a ranch)

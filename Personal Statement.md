# Personal Statement

I have gone down the rabbit hole that is programming by sheer luck. I wasnâ€™t particularly interested in computers, I played video games but never wanted to create them, I saw myself as a future screenwriter rather than computer-scientist. That all changed when I stumbled on a website on my school iPad in Year 5: Codecademy.com. I completed the Python 2 course, created some extremely basic projects (note-taking app, password manager, ) and forgot about it for a year and a half.

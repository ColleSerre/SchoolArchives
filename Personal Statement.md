# Personal Statement

I have gone down the rabbit hole that is programming by sheer luck. I wasn’t particularly interested in computers, I played video games but never wanted to create them, I saw myself as a future screenwriter rather than computer-scientist. That all changed when I stumbled on a website on my school iPad. Of course, the device was managed by my school meant that we didn’t have access to many sites, by sheer luck, codecademy.com made the list. I remember being in my bed, in year 8

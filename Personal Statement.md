# Personal Statement

I have gone down the rabbit hole that is programming by sheer luck. I wasnâ€™t particularly interested in computers, I played video games but never wanted to create them, I saw myself as a future screenwriter rather than computer-scientist. That all changed when I stumbled on a website on my school iPad: Codecademy.com. This website completely changed my life. I started learning python 2 (because you had to pay extra to learn python 3)

# 2.3 Photosynthesis

### *The effect of light on plants*

Objectives:

* What is photosynthesis ?
* Efficiency of photosynthesis
  * Light absorption by plants (practical) => using a spectrophotometer
* Other effects 

**Photosynthesis** is a function of the amount of light received. It varies throughout the day. Occurs in chloroplasts of green plant cells.
**Respiration** is an energy production in all living things. It is generally constant.

Chemical equation for photosynthesis:
$$
6H_20 + 6CO_2 + \text{light} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2
$$

### Post-lab questions:

What information does the spectrophotometer tell you about the efficiency of photosynthesis ?
The spectrophotometer tells us that photosynthesis is very effective for some lights. It absorbs mostly red and blue lights but isn't efficient on green light (the chlorophyll is also green) and yellow light. Not all wavelengths are absorbed.

What else happens to light when it encounters plants ?

Reflection. It gets absorbed by other parts => heats up the plant. Transmitted (goes through the plant)

### Outcome

Only 1 and 2% of the light that reaches a plant can be converted by photosynthesis into biomass (glucose).

### The effect of light on plants (not photosynthesis)

Transpiration: loss of water by plants due to light ; more light = more transpiration
Regulation by stomata -> they can open/close
Plants are the origin of biomass

### Efficiency of photosynthesis

Very little glucose is produced
Losses: reflection/transmission ; conversion to heat/wrong wavelength (red+blue only)
Limitations: water/CO2/Nutrients
loses in biomass between trophic levels -> respiration uses glucose ; Biomass stored in trunks/bones and other inedible parts ; 90% lost between each trophic level
Fossil fuels: forms over millions of years ; need pressure/heat ; amount of C  -> determines state (coal/petrol/natural gas)

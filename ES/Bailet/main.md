# 2.2 (5) Earth's Energy Budget

## The balance between the energy received by the Sun and that emitted by the Earth

---------

Objectives:

* Understand solar constants
* Explain the difference between Earth's solar constant and the energy received on Earth

Solar Constant: The energy received from the Sun by celestial bodies

<span style="color: red;">Earth's solar constant = 1.360 W/m²</span>

Energy received on the surface of the earth = 340 W/m². Some light has either been reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere.

Solar energy at the surface is a **variable**:

* Larger planets can absorb more light
* The curvature of the Earth spreads the energy out to different degrees depending on the latitude
* Sunlight is absorbed, reflected, and refracted on its path through the atmosphere to the surface

<span style="color: red;">The ozone layer, mostly made out of O2, absorbs UV light. </span>

# What happens to light when it reaches the surface?

-----------

Objectives:

* Albedo of Earth
* Greenhouse effect

Albedo: The relationship between the light energy reflected by a surface and the light energy it receives
**Earth's planetary albedo is about 31%**, meaning that about a third of the light that reaches the surface is reflected out to space.

| Sample          | Ice | Sand | Grass | Oceans | Cotton |
| --------------- | --- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Light reflected | 137 | 56   | 30    | 20     | 12     |

## The greenhouse effect

Infrared light is reflected from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface which causes a build-up of heat.

Greenhouse gases:

* Absorb/reflect infrared light 
* CO2, CH4, H2O
  The earth and moon have a solar constant of 1360 W/m², the only difference is that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere. *All bodies emit a small amount of infrared light*. The earth emits 240 W/m² of infrared light on average.

Questions:

1. Temperature today => 13-14 C ; Concentration today => H2O=70%, *CO2=388*, *CH4=1.843*, N2O=0.316 ; Ice Age temp => 7-8 C ; Concentration ice age => H2O=?, *CO2=180*, *CH4=0.380*, N2H=0.215
2. Temperature today => 13-14 C ; Concentration today => H2O=70%, *CO2=388*, *CH4=1.843*, N2O=0.316 ; 1750 temp => 14-15 ; Concentration 1750 => H20=70%, *CO2=280*, *CH4=0.730*, N2H=0.270 
3. The temp would drop to -20 C


# 2.3 Photosynthesis

### *The effect of light on plants*

Objectives:

* What is photosynthesis ?
* Efficiency of photosynthesis
  * Light absorption by plants (practical) => using a spectrophotometer
* Other effects 

**Photosynthesis** is a function of the amount of light received. It varies throughout the day. Occurs in chloroplasts of green plant cells.
**Respiration** is an energy production in all living things. It is generally constant.

Chemical equation for photosynthesis:
$$
6H_20 + 6CO_2 + \text{light} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2
$$

### Post-lab questions:

What information does the spectrophotometer tell you about the efficiency of photosynthesis ?
The spectrophotometer tells us that photosynthesis is very effective for some lights. It absorbs mostly red and blue lights but isn't efficient on green light (the chlorophyll is also green) and yellow light. Not all wavelengths are absorbed.

What else happens to light when it encounters plants ?

Reflection. It gets absorbed by other parts => heats up the plant. Transmitted (goes through the plant)

### Outcome

Only 1 and 2% of the light that reaches a plant can be converted by photosynthesis into biomass (glucose).

---

### The effect of light on plants (not photosynthesis)

Transpiration: loss of water by plants due to light ; more light = more transpiration
Regulation by stomata -> they can open/close
Plants are the origin of biomass

### Efficiency of photosynthesis

Very little glucose is produced
Losses: reflection/transmission ; conversion to heat/wrong wavelength (red+blue only)
Limitations: water/CO2/Nutrients
loses in biomass between trophic levels -> respiration uses glucose ; Biomass stored in trunks/bones and other inedible parts ; 90% lost between each trophic level
Fossil fuels: forms over millions of years ; need pressure/heat ; amount of C  -> determines state (coal/petrol/natural gas)

Basal metabolic rate: minimum intake to be alive

## How can energy in food be measured and what are the limitations to the method?

	-> Work safely and collect/record data in a neat table

	-> Process data as a graph

	-> Describe and explain results

	-> Evaluate the method 

		-> Find errors and explain
		
		
$$\text{Energy (J/g)}=\frac{\text{(final temperature} - \text{start temperature (°C))} \cdot \text{mass of water (g)}}{\text{(mass of food burned (g))}}$$

Constants:

* Weigh-boat: 4,52 g

| | Mass of food burned (g) | start temperature (°C) | final temperature (°C) | Energy |

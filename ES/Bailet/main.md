# 2.2 (5) Earth's Energy Budget

## The balance between the energy received by the Sun and that emitted by the Earth

---------

Objectives:

* Understand solar constants
* Explain the difference between Earth's solar constant and the energy received on Earth

Solar Constant: The energy received from the Sun by celestial bodies

<span style="color: red;">Earth's solar constant = 1.360 W/m²</span>

Energy received on the surface of the earth = 340 W/m². Some light has either been reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere.

Solar energy at the surface is a **variable**:

* Larger planets can absorb more light
* The curvature of the Earth spreads the energy out to different degrees depending on the latitude
* Sunlight is absorbed, reflected, and refracted on its path through the atmosphere to the surface

<span style="color: red;">The ozone layer, mostly made out of O2, absorbs UV light. </span>

# What happens to light when it reaches the surface?

-----------

Objectives:

* Albedo of Earth
* Greenhouse effect

Albedo: The relationship between the light energy reflected by a surface and the light energy it receives
**Earth's planetary albedo is about 31%**, meaning that about a third of the light that reaches the surface is reflected out to space.

| Sample          | Ice | Sand | Grass | Oceans | Cotton |
| --------------- | --- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Light reflected | 137 | 56   | 30    | 20     | 12     |

## The greenhouse effect

Infrared light is reflected from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface which causes a build-up of heat.

Greenhouse gases:

* Absorb/reflect infrared light 
* CO2, CH4, H2O
  The earth and moon have a solar constant of 1360 W/m², the only difference is that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere. *All bodies emit a small amount of infrared light*. The earth emits 240 W/m² of infrared light on average.

Questions:

1. Temperature today →=> 13-14 C ; Concentration today →=> H2O=70%, *CO2=388*, *CH4=1.843*, N2O=0.316 ; Ice Age temp →=> 7-8 C ; Concentration ice age →=> H2O=?, *CO2=180*, *CH4=0.380*, N2H=0.215
2. Temperature today →=> 13-14 C ; Concentration today →=> H2O=70%, *CO2=388*, *CH4=1.843*, N2O=0.316 ; 1750 temp →=> 14-15 ; Concentration 1750 →=> H20=70%, *CO2=280*, *CH4=0.730*, N2H=0.270 
3. The temp would drop to -20 C


# 2.3 Photosynthesis

### *The effect of light on plants*

Objectives:

* What is photosynthesis ?
* Efficiency of photosynthesis
  * Light absorption by plants (practical) →=> using a spectrophotometer
* Other effects 

**Photosynthesis** is a function of the amount of light received. It varies throughout the day. Occurs in chloroplasts of green plant cells.
**Respiration** is an energy production in all living things. It is generally constant.

Chemical equation for photosynthesis:
$$
6H_20 + 6CO_2 + \text{light} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2
$$

### Post-lab questions:

What information does the spectrophotometer tell you about the efficiency of photosynthesis ?
The spectrophotometer tells us that photosynthesis is very effective for some lights. It absorbs mostly red and blue lights but isn't efficient on green light (the chlorophyll is also green) and yellow light. Not all wavelengths are absorbed.

What else happens to light when it encounters plants ?

Reflection. It gets absorbed by other parts →=> heats up the plant. Transmitted (goes through the plant)

### Outcome

Only 1 and 2% of the light that reaches a plant can be converted by photosynthesis into biomass (glucose).

---

### The effect of light on plants (not photosynthesis)

Transpiration: loss of water by plants due to light ; more light = more transpiration
Regulation by stomata →-> they can open/close
Plants are the origin of biomass

### Efficiency of photosynthesis

Very little glucose is produced
Losses: reflection/transmission ; conversion to heat/wrong wavelength (red+blue only)
Limitations: water/CO2/Nutrients
loses in biomass between trophic levels →-> respiration uses glucose ; Biomass stored in trunks/bones and other inedible parts ; 90% lost between each trophic level
Fossil fuels: forms over millions of years ; need pressure/heat ; amount of C  →-> determines state (coal/petroleum/natural gas)

Basal metabolic rate: minimum intake to be alive

## How can energy in food be measured, and what are the limitations to the method? [Google Ddocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GU7Y2yr5OYIeIn8Cf8MiO2wweYV7SvdZ2ruLAOOVNVc/edit)

	-> Work safely and collect/record data in a neat table

	-> Process data as a graph

	-> Describe and explain results

	-> Evaluate the method 

		-> Find errors and explain
		
		
$$\text{Energy (J/g)}=\frac{\text{(final temperature} - \text{start temperature (°C))} \cdot \text{mass of water (g)}}{\text{(mass of food burned (g))}}$$

# 2.4 Human Energy Budget

* Homeostatic regulation of body temperature
	- Negative feedback loops 
* Examples:
	- Cold shock response
	- Effect of alcohol
	- Effects of cigarettes
	- Effects of clothes

## Homeostatic regulation of body temperature

Homeostasis = Body temperature is constant (about 37° C). Different processes ensure that this temperature remains constant.

To make heat:

* Muscles contract (movement)
* Organs produce energy 

To lose heat:

* Sweating (when sweat evaporates it takes some of the heat with it)
* Conduction (touching something cold)
* Convection (heat moving through a fluid, through air)

## Negative feedback

The hypothalamus senses the temperature of blood 
Vasoconstriction: increases body temperature by constricting blood vessels to avoid heat loss from the skin
Shivering: muscles contract and radiate heat.

Questions:

1. [Xmind doc](Under the sun for a long time.xmind)
2. Cool off before going into water, rince your neck (where the hypothalamus is), do not jump in, wait for digestion to take place
3. You generate less energy while sleeping than while walking 
4. Cigarettes stops peripheral blood flow completely. This could be because it interferes with the hypothalamus, which provokes vasoconstriction

# 3.2/9 - Age of the Earth

Estimated age: 4.2 billion years old

Louis-Leclerc, Darwin, Kelvin

* Calculate the age of the Earth based on historical measurements
* Identify uncertainties with these estimations

## Calculation 1:

Calculating the coefficient directeur de la fuonction: 37, 5$x$

37,5 $\cdot$ 12 600 $\cdot 10^5$ = 89 835 years

The graph was not precise enough, and we can’t see if the initial value is zero, the calculation was only made on size, not on mass, not on temperature or matter. The instrument for measuring temperature was his finger which led to the graph being imprecise. 

## Calculation 2:
 
 $ \frac{1,17}{3 500 000} \cdot 100= $299 145 299.1,1$ years
 
 The limitation of this model is the estimation of the rate of erosion which can be false due to a short study time, the climate changed during the life of the earth. This estimation doesn’t account for this change and doesn’t take into account for the movement of the tectonic plates. It assumes that the valley was there at the Earth’s formation. 

## Calculation 3:

Geothermal gradient: amount of heat lost per km

Using heat of rocks to calculate the age of the earth.

Age of earth: 125 million but it isn’t made of only one type of rock so is wrong, assumed that the geothermal gradient would be the same from the surface to the centrer of the earth.

Between a 100million and 1 billion

## Calculation 4:

Sediment deposition rate: 8,56/1000 years

Age of the earth: 390 million years

$\frac{22\cdot10^5}{8,56}\cdot1000 = 257 009 345, 8$ years

The sedimentation rate isn’t really precise as the samples aren’t all in the same areas. Doesn’t take into account erosion. 

# 3.2 History of the age of the Earth

* Radioactivity
* Half-life
* Radiometric-dating
	* Draw thea best fit curve
	* Find the equation of a line

Radioactivity: It is the spontaneous change of one unstable atom into a more stable atom, releasing energy Example: $C-14 \rightarrow N-14+1e^-$

Half life: The amount ofo time it takes, for half the number of unstable nuclei in a source to decay. 

Isotopes: Different versions of the same atom (C-14 and C-12)

Carbon 14 differs from Carbon 12 (the one in the periodic table) because it has two more neutrons. When it radiates, Carbon 14 turns into Nitrogen. The time it takes for an element to decay to half its mass is called the **half-life**. We don’t know how long it takes for one Carbon 14 to decompose how long it takes but for a lot of it we do know how long it will take for half of it to decay.

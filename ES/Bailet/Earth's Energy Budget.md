# 2.2 (5) Earth's Energy Budget
## The balance between the energy received by the Sun and that emitted by the Earth
---------
Objectives:
* Understand solar constants
* Explain the difference between Earth's solar constant and the energy received on Earth

Solar Constant: The energy received from the Sun by celestial bodies

<span style="color: red;">Earth's solar constant = 1.360 W/m²</span>

Energy received on the surface of the earth = 340 W/m². Some light has either been reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere.

Solar energy at the surface is a **variable**:
* Larger planets can absorb more light
* The curvature of the Earth spreads the energy out to different degrees depending on the latitude
* Sunlight is absorbed, reflected, and refracted on its path through the atmosphere to the surface

<span style="color: red;">The ozone layer, mostly made out of O3, absorbs UV light. </span>

# What happens to light when it reaches the surface?
-----------
Objectives:
* Albedo of Earth
* Greenhouse effect

Albedo: The relationship between the light energy reflected by a surface and the light energy it receives
**Earth's planetary albedo is about 31%**, meaning that about a third of the light that reaches the surface is reflected out to space.

|Sample|Ice|Sand  |Grass  |Oceans  |Cotton  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----|----|
|Light reflected     |137         |56         |30         |20 | 120|

## The greenhouse effect

Infrared light is reflected from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface which causes a build-up of heat.

Greenhouse gases:
* Absorb/reflect infrared light 
* CO2, CH4, H2O
The earth and moon have a solar constant of 1360 W/m², the only difference is that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere. *All bodies emit a small amount of infrared light*. The earth emits 240 W/m² of infrared light on average.

Questions:
1. Temperature today => 13-14 C ; Concentration today => H2O=70%, *CO2=388*, *CH4=1.843*, N2O=0.316 ; Ice Age temp => 7-8 C ; Concentration ice age => H2O=?, *CO2=180*, *CH4=0.380*, N2H=0.215
2. Temperature today => 13-14 C ; Concentration today => H2O=70%, *CO2=388*, *CH4=1.843*, N2O=0.316 ; 1750 temp => 14-15 ; Concentration 1750 => H20=70%, *CO2=280*, *CH4=0.730*, N2H=0.270 
3. The temp would drop to -20 C

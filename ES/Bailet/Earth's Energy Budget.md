# 2.2 (5) Earth's Energy Budget
## The balance between the energy received by the Sun and that emitted by the Earth
---------
Objectives:
* Understand solar constants
* Explain the difference between Earth's solar constant and the energy received on Earth

Solar Constant: The energy received from the Sun by celestial bodies

<span style="color: red;">Earth's solar constant = 1.360 W/m²</span>

Energy received on the surface of the earth = 340 W/m². Some light has either been reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere.

Solar energy at the surface is a **variable**:
* Larger planets can absorb more light
* The curvature of the Earth spreads the energy out to different degrees depending on the latitude
* Sunlight is absorbed, reflected and refracted on its path through the atmosphere to the surface

<span style="color: red;">The ozone layer, mostly made out of O3, absorbs UV light.</span>

# What happens to light when it reaches the surface?
-----------
Objectives:
* Albedo of Earth
* Greenhouse effect

Albedo: The relationship between the light energy reflected by a surface and the light energy it receives
**Earth's planetary albedo is about 31%**, meaning that about a third of the light that reaches the surface is reflected out to space.

# American imperialism and the Spanish-American War

## What were the motivations leading the United-States to the acquisition of an Empire

This is **contradictory** because the US were born out of an empire and fought themselves out of an empire.

### Imperialism 

Greatest empires: Mongol (on one continent), British (on several continents)

Definition: State policy, practice, or advocacy of extending power and dominion, especially by direct territorial acquisition or by gaining political and economic control of other areas.

Examples of American imperialism:

* Guantanamo bay (in Cuba)

Monroe Doctrine (1823) [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_Monroe#:~:text=La%20doctrine%20de%20Monroe%20a,d%C3%A9but%20du%20XX%20e%20si%C3%A8cle.)

It embodies isolationism (a foreign strategy which consists on focusing on internal affairs and not foreign affairs). Basically “mind your own business” to europeans. This led to South America being considered as the US’s backyard (“America’s Backyard”). This means that South America is under the US’s protection and therefore, europeans have no business in it.

MAIN factors:

* Markets (Economic)
* American Exceptionalism (ideological)
* International competition (political)
* Naval power (military)

National interest: Defined by the people in power (representatives, president, king, army...), the nation’s interests come first. It can be defined by the leader’s values/interests. This adapts to context: sanitary, (geo)political, historical, economic) 

Difference between country and nation: country is defined by borders, nation is defined by culture, identity, has patriotism, is defined by a people/ethnic group

## 1. Economic reasons: Markets and raw materials

- Great Britain: a model and a **rival** (depending on who was in power)
- Fear that US would be **left out of the global race** for markets and resources
- 1893: global economic depression (realising that prosperity is fragile) => **fear of social unrest** (solution to this is patriotism)

## 2. Ideological Reasons: American Exceptionalism & Social Darwinism (related to the manifest destiny)

- Ideological shift in political mindset of most politicians
- Belief in the white man’s superiority and duty to uplift “backward people”
- Inspired by Charles Darwin’s works on evolution
	- Using the theory of Darwin to create a social hierarchy (excuse to be racist by passing on a “scientific” theory ?) 
- Fuelled by waves of immigration to the US’

## 3. Military factor: naval power

“Whoever rules the waves rules the world”, Alfred T Mahan, *The influence of Sea Power upon history*

Henry Cabot Lodge (openly racist, xenophobic, against immigration): The US must expand to compete, creating an empire to compete with others. 

Carl Schurz (journalist): The US should become a power for peace, dedicated to morals, thought the US should defend its interests but should strive for peace.

Josiah Strong: The US should spread Anglo-Saxon civilisation. 

Alfred T. Mahan: The US must become a great sea-power

# The Spanish-American War

After the war Guam, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines belonged to the US. At the time, Spain was the closest country to the US. 

* Cuba independence movement 
	* Failure of Ten Years War (1868-1878)
	* José Marti, leader of the movement; use of guerrilla warfare
	* Brutal Spanish measures; deportation to camps
	* President McKinley pressured Spain to put an end to the situation (1893: attempted coup in Hawaï; US refused to support it)
	* “Yellow journalism”
		* Newspapers and journalists that used shocking titles and ambiguous exposition of facts to sell newspapers (kind of the ancestor of fake news).
		* They tried to reproduce the narrative that took place between England and the US before independence. This follows the Monroe doctrine.
	* The situation escalated when a US boat was allegedly sank by Spain.
		* The USS Maine (sent to protect American property and interests in Cuba) exploded and sank with 260 sailors, the US blamed Spanish sabotage
		* Teller Amendment
			* Later linked to the Platte Amendment which allows the US to do basically whatever they saw fit to ensure Cuba’s independence

## A splendid little war

* Lasted 6 weeks
* Teddy Roosevelt and “The Rough Riders”
* Platt Amendment
* Treaty of Paris: Spain ceded the Philippines for $20 million; neither Filipinos nor Cubans were invited to the negotiations
* Filipinos didn’t get their independence and turned against the US but were defeated in 1901
* America ended up controlling Cuba, and annexing Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.

# Change and Continuity in the American Society (1870-1914) - How did industrialisation affect Americans' lives in the 19th century

## Industrialisation

Process by which a formerly agrarian society turned into an industrial and urban one. Goods were produced in mass quantities thanks to machines in factories and technical innovation. For the first time, people were paid by someone else.

First Industrial Revolution: end of the 18th century - 1830s/1840s started in England

2nd Industrial Revolution: late 19th century - early 20th; urbanisation, development of telecommunication and transport

### The Gilded Age - Mark Twain (1877-c. 1900)

The expression "Gilded Age" is opposed to "Golden Age" which means that the times of the 2nd Industrial Revolution were only good in appearance.

Industrialisation can be compared to the manifest destiny. 

## Urbanisation and Immigration

Industrialisation was a direct consequence of the Civil War because it boosted clothing and weapon manufacturing as well as telegraph and railway (communications). War brought destruction across the South. Buildings, communication systems, the economy, and transportation infrastructure had to be rebuilt. 

Europeans: escaped starvation, famine, poverty, low-wages (working their land), religious & political persecution (Jews & German activists). They found jobs in the city (factories, domestic servants if they were women), some became entrepreneurs and became rich (like the first wave of immigration).

Women: domestic servants or factory workers.

Chinese: Worked in mines & the railroad industry. Were discriminated against in SF, lacked civil rights.

## World Exposition of Chicago (1893)

Was attended by millions of people, the point was to show the US's ability to mass produce and innovate. The exposition was held 401 years after Columbus' arrival in the Americas. This was a major theme in the Word Exposition as they made a lake and reproduced some of Columbus' ships. This can also be linked to the manifest destiny as it means that the Americans believed that nothing was achieved by the natives.

The construction of the first skyscrapers in Chicago produced a boom in population in East Coast cities (300k to 1.7M) in 30 years. This demographic growth was mostly supported by immigration which took place in two waves: one that was mostly made of Anglos-Saxons and Irish and the second which introduced Russians, Italians and a small percentage of Asians and Canadians. Two points were crucial to integration: religion and language, asians who didn't have either were largely discriminated against. 

## DST correction

1. Cartoon drawn by Joseph Keppler in *Puck*, a weekly satyrical newspaper in 1893. He was a former immigrant. It deals with the way that immigrants were treated in the US back in the 1980s
2. To denounce selfishness of successful businessmen who used to be immigrants themselves, the absurdity, hypocrisy of the business class and to raise awareness about immigrants' condition
3. Puck is not an informative newspaper, its purpose is to make satire out of the news and, therefore, their representation isn't objective. Furthermore, the artist was a former immigrant. The cartoon doesn't show the positive aspects of 

# Industrialization & social change

1969: The first transcontinenetal railroad allowed to transport raw materials, people (settlers, immigrants, workers), cattle, manufactured goods accross the country. This allowed
a better access to Europe. This engeniering feat also showed the power of the US. 

## Robber Barons

The development of the railroad helped the emergeance of "robber barons", industrialists who manipulated markets, set up monopolies and mistreated workers. There is a 
historiographical debate on the latter point as they increased salaries. 

## John D. Rockefeller

He helped form the American Dream. He rose to wealth thanks to his good grades in school. He then rose through the ranks while learning the importance of stocks and railroads.
He heavily invested in oil raffinerie after meeting with Colonel Drake, the creator of the oil drill. He bought out the shares of his partners and became the soul boss. He bought out
his competitors (horizontal integration) and engaged in predatory prices to establish a monopoly on oil with his company Standard Oil. The US Supreme Court forced the company to
divide in 1911 as it was a threat to the integrity of the US. He created the Rockefeller center.  

## Social Changes

Between 1870 and 1910, agriculture shrunk proportionally to other sectors but rose in numbers. This is due to immigration and the increase of population. This demographic growth led to a bigger demand for jobs and bigger demand for food. Trade went 6x up in 40 years (in numbers). More production=more exports. Manufacturing 5,5x up in numbers.

These increased numbers are explained by the invention of the automated assembly line. 

The main fight for trade-unions were 8 hour days and child labour, children often lost limbs and got hurt during work and worked 14 hours a day.

* The Knights of Labor (1869)
* The National Railroad Strike (1877)
* American Federation of Labor (1885)
* Haymarket Massacre (Chicago - 1886)

The railroad industry was the most prominent striker. This is because the jobs were dangerous, it was a booming industry on which the whole economy depended. This gave the trade unions a lot of leveraging power. Mostly in the North East in the Rust Belt and San Francisco which opened towards the Pacific.

## Haymarket Square Massacre (1886)

The unions called for workers to meet in mass, armed and in full force. A bomb was detonated in the crowd, it is unclear who threw the bomb. The leaders of this movement were hanged in very peculiar trial: 
	
	« Il n'y a qu'un pas de la République à l'anarchie. C'est la loi qui subit ici son procès en même temps que l'anarchisme. Ces huit hommes ont été choisis parce qu'ils sont 	des meneurs. Ils ne sont pas plus coupables que les milliers de personnes qui les suivent.
	Messieurs du jury : condamnez ces hommes, faites d'eux un exemple, faites-les pendre et vous sauverez nos institutions et notre société.
	C'est vous qui déciderez si nous allons faire ce pas vers l'anarchie, ou non. » 

## Settlement in the West 

Cowboys were a myth that represented freedom and lawlessness, courage, independence. Most of these were fictitious because cowboys worked in group and led cattle towards railroads so they could be “manufactured”. The export of wheat increased 17x. This led to a huge demand for land and a westward expansion.

# To what extent was the Treaty of Versailles justified ?

The treaty was anticipated to create a lot of resentment in Germany, but they did it anyway. War casualties: 22 million for Allies, 37.5 for Central Powers. Russia suffered the most (9 million casualties) followed by Germany (5.7 million). This led to a smaller working class in the two countries and a more difficult recovery. The Spanish flu caused 50-50 million death. Trotsky negotiated peace with Germany. Roads, houses, and hospitals had to be rebuilt. Unexploded shells had to be handled. 
**The Russian Revolution: ** First Communist government formed in 1917. Winners torn between the need to punish those responsible for the war and keeping the world "*safe*" from communism. Besides, communism tends to spread on misery and the countries who were in the war were all miserable.

## The Treaty of Versailles

The treaty was signed in Versailles because France surrendered in 1870 to Prussia. Versailles represents one of the peaks of French power and influence â†’ humiliating. It was signed on January 18 because it was the day the German Empire was founded. The big four winners met at Versailles. Germany and Russia had no say in the negotiations. The prior because they lost, the latter because they were commies. 

4 objectives:

1. To make Germany pay (Clemenceau's other objective, he hated Germany because he was already there in 1870)
2. To cripple Germany, so it could not start another war (Clemenceau's main objective, supported by GB)
3. to reward winning countries (Italy's main objective, GB wanted the German colonies)
4. establish a just and lasting peace (Wilson's main objective, GB wanted this because war is bad for trade)

Wilson's 14 points:

1. End all secret treaties
2. Freedom of the Seas
3. Free trade
4. Reduce national armies
5. Colonial fairness
6. rearranging borders (self-determination)
7. Create a general association of nations that would negotiate solutions to world conflicts

### Impact of the treaty on Germany

* Geographical: territorial losses (in the east and colonies)
* Demographical: less labour force and soldiers (end of German militarism)
* Economical: loss of raw material and industrial production power. Had to pay the equivalent of $33 Billion to the allies
* Political: the Weimar Republic
* Buffer zone created between Belgium and Germany (Rhineland)
* Moral: The Germans had to take full responsibility for the war (article 231)
* Diplomatically: excluded from negotiations and League of Nations

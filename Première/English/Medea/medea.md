# Medea

-------------

## Prologue

Information brought by the nurse:

* It was a love affair
* Jason is to blame
  * Jason broke a vow/pledge
* **Medea has given up everything for Jason (helping him get the golden fleece, killed her brother + father) => Medea is the victim**
* The audience knows more than Medea <= **Dramatic irony** + sympathy for Medea 
* *Medea is scary*
  * Medea plans to do something bad to her children <= **foreshadowing**/foreboding

## First Episode

Questions:

1. * Medea is angry at everyone as her husband just betrayed her
     * The nurse takes her time as she probably won't manage to persuade Medea to come with her
     * Medea "glares at [the servants] like a mad bull"
2. The chorus understands Medea's tragic situation, they feel sympathy for her: "my own heart suffers too"
3. They encourage her not to kill herself, "she's foolish for wanting to die"
4. She tries to appeal to the women in the chorus with relatable stuff about the position of women in ancient Greece. She also uses emotions to convince the chorus that she is a victim.
5. She describes the fact that women didn't have will over their own body, didn't have the choice of a husband and their lives depended on their husband being good or bad. She also said that she'd rather stand 3 times in the frontline than bear a child.
6. Creon initially addresses Medea with an exclamative sentence, "you there Medea" (probably pointing @ her).  Creon is a leader, a king but admits that he is scared of her and fears her shrewdness (intelligence).
7. She tries to reassure him and says "I bear no grudge against *your* happiness". To persuade him to let her live in Corinth!
8. She appeals to his ego, "I beg you! Will you cast off pity, and banish me? [...] How my thoughts turn to you now!"
9. Creon says "Medea, poor Medea!, Your grief touches our hearts. A wanderer, where can you turn ? To what welcoming house? To what protecting land? How wild with dread and danger is the sea where the gods have set your course!

p. 27 => Medea is plotting & reveals her plan

Words connected with plotting:

* I have in mind so many paths of death
* Except to carry out my purpose, carry out my schemes?
* My chosen accomplice

Her plan => Today three of my enemies I shall strike dead: Father and daughter; and my husband.

**Creates suspense (this is her plan but will she go through with it?)**

## First Stasimon

1. The chorus says that deceit was once used by women and is now used by men. They also say that up to now stories were told by men and depicted women as always having the bad role (Hellen of Troy, Medea) but they say that these will fall out of fashion and that female authors and artists will replace them.
2. We can feel sympathy for Medea because she is alone in an unknown land, without her husband, banished.

## Second Episode

1. Blames her for the situation, says she's lucky for not getting killed, self-deceiving and hypocrisy => he is still her friend + "have carefully considered / Your problem". 
2. I saved your life, I killed the serpent, I lit the way for your escape, I betrayed my father, I killed Pelias, I have borne your sons AND Jason broke an oath. This shows that, unlike what Jason is saying, Medea (and by extension women) is able of a well-structured and logical argument.
3. Tries to downplay Medea's role in his success ant to suggest it is more down to the gods like Aphrodite. He also claims that Medea only fell in love with him due to Hera. He also says she's gained from her link with him: she is famous and she lives in a civilized place = this reminds her that she is a foreigner and so marks her out as different. Overuse of I = arrogance. Wants wealth and status "I want to ensure...that we should live well/And not be poor;" "I thought it worth while to ensure advantages/for those I have". He focuses on his wealth and status whilst she thinks about how he has broken his oath to her. Medea (ln 579-627) suggests here that the skill in rhetoric shown by Jason actually shows his great insincerity. She argues that if this really was his plan, he should have told her about it first and not gone behind her back. Note that the wrestling imagery "One word will throw you". This is typical in legal language.
4. He argues that he has done all of this for his children. In order to give the a better future. BUT he has not made any effort to keep them in Corinth, so this argument seems to ring untrue.

## Third Episode

1. Aegeus behaves with Medea in a much more friendly way than Jason. Jason has sons but doesn't take good care of them whilst Aegeus wants children and wants to take care of them well. 
2. This use of stichomythia contrasts with the way it was used with Jason. One was a casual talk & the other was a rapid-fired argument. This shows the different ways that stichomythia can be used and the effects it can have.
3. She promises to give plants/potion to Aegeus to help him with his fertility. This is ironic because Medea will later kill her children.
4. The Homeric Hero is often seeking revenge
5. She plans to agree with Jason to bait him ? Then kill his children to hurt Jason
6. NULL

## Fourth Episode

Questions:

1. We are aware of Medea's plans. There's a lot of irony regarding her plans: "Oh children! Will you All your *lives long*, stretch out your hands to me like this?" => ironic because her children will die soon, their hands stretched to stop her from killing them. "Greet your father, as I do, and and put your arms round him. Forget our quarrel, and *love him as your mother does.*" => basically tells them to hate their father. "In time, I'm sure, you with your brothers will be leading men" => she's going to kill all of them. 

## Fourth Stasimon

vocabulary:

* spare
* burden - a nuissance
* incessant - without end/doesn't stop
* rear - to bring up children 
* bequeath - the action of adding someone in your will

## Fifth Episode

1. The kids enter the palace hand in hand
2. The servants greet them and the messenger follows them to the princess's room
3. The princess was angry to see the children in her room
4. Jason calms her and tells her that she "must not be unfriendly to our friends" and that "Those your husband loves You must love too", asks her to cancel the children's exile and to take the gifts
5. The children give her the embroidered gown, she puts it around her, dances and poses in front of mirror
6. Glauce changes color, starts shaking, collapses on a chair, an old attendant starts singing the cry of worship
7. White froth starts coming out of her mouth, her pupils twist
8. The golden crown lights her head on fire, she's engulfed in flames, the dress eats her flesh
9. Gets up, runs around shaking her head to get the coronet off. She's head bleeding and her shin is melting
10. Father enters and tries to lift her upright but can't because any use of strength will tear her flesh
11. The king burns with his daughter, he gets stuck to her when he tries to lift her up

Very vivid details, use of direct speech (makes it more lively). Glauce's love for Jason blinds her ("She had eyes only for Jason"). Glauce is a materialistic person ("When she saw those lovely things she was won over")

Medea resolves to kill her children. This short and urgent speech show her determination to do the deed. The fact that she has been on stage for such a long time makes her departure even more dramatic. Added to this is the reason for her leaving.

## 5th Stasimon

Medea leaves and the Chorus appeals for the murder to be prevented. They sing in DOCHMIACS - an excited meter that expresses their emotional turmoil.
a. They appeal to the Earth and Sun to intervene
b. In the antistrophe, they focus on the wasted time spent bringing up her children, and they warn her that the shedding of kindred blood causes pollution and divine punishment. 
As the infanticide approaches, a scream is heard from inside the house. The fact that the children's cries interrupt the regular choral ode, creates a powerful dramatic moment.

The fact that the children aren't on stage forces the audience to imagine the children's murder.

## Exodus

ironic- superhuman - save - misery - himself - chariot - stichomythia - burying

1. She has the power to refuse stuff to Jason, she absolutely refuses to give him the dead bodies of  their children for a burial. She also leaves riding on a flying chariot which is an metaphor for her superiority.
2. He keeps repeating that she killed their children and that it'll hurt her as much as it did him.
3. Medea is dominating Jason when she was dominated by Jason and Creon. You could argue that she lost more than Jason but this characteristic is key to the dramatic hero.

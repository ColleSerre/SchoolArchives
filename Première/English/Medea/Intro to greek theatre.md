Greeks considered music and theatre to have healing properties (this theatre was built next to a healing center)
55 rows of seats, 14000 spectators in the theatron
Perfect acoustics thanks to *resonators* (a coin falling in the center could be heard in the seats far behind)
Painted wall behind the actors to represent the scenery

## Oil

Russia is the second larges oil exporting country in the world which means that this industry is very powerful and has a lot of bargaining power. We've all heard of Russian Oligarchs that made a ton of money after the soviet union fell. Most of Russia's oil is produced by Roznef and Lukoil and in the

Western Siberian region. Siberia, as you know, is very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer and has therefore very few infrastructures, towns and inhabitants. The region started to be industrialised and used for oil production in 1975 during the Brezhnev economical stagnation era, they built

a pipeline network of 82K km dedicated to crude oil transportation because, as you might expect, transporting goods through Siberia is neither fast nor cost-effective. Many workers were needed to build such a gigantic network so what did the soviet union do ?

GULAGS ! Yep they used political prisoners to build parts of this absolutely huge pipeline network, who else would you use to build 80 thousand km of metal tubes in the freezing cold Siberian weather? Fortunately, the USSR fell and with it Russia's oil output

The industry took 8 years to fully recover from this trauma but output drastically increased in 1999 mostly due to the use of new technology and privatisation of the sector although it still hasn't beat the soviet union's all time high (11.61 million barrels per day in October 2018 vs a 12.58 million barrels per day peak in 1988).

To gather up, the oil industry has been changing rural spaces since the 1970s and has industrialised the western Siberian region for the sake of facilitating transportation and overcoming the challenges that such an unconquered territory brings.

## Coal

Coal is Russia's fourth most important export. Just like oil, most of Russia's coal is produced in Siberia, this time it's southwest and central Siberia (84%). Russia supplies 4% of the world's coal and

has survived both the fall of the Soviet Union and

Russia's 1998 financial crisis as well as the 2008 financial crisis, and it actually turned a profit from 2008, and although it still hasn't reached the Soviet-era production levels (425 million tons in 1988, only 329 million tons in 2008).

The sector has significantly changed the rural areas, for example the CIA conducted a study called "Environmental Protection in the Soviet Union: More Smoke Than Fire" and released to the public in 2010 that found that the extensive mining in the region has led to "increasing deaths and genetic defects among babies". Furthermore, another study from the British Geographical Survey has hound that  "Annual methane emissions into the atmosphere from Kuzbass coal mines amount to 1â€“2 billion cubic meters", with much of that coming from now abandoned mines.

A war has also been going on in the Donets (which is very rich in coal) region since April 2014 between pro-Russian separatists, affiliated with the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics and Ukrainian government. This war has been started by Russian citizens as an effort to destabilise the Ukrainian government to take control of the region and its large coal industry. The Russian government is suspected to be behind this.

In conclusion, the humongous coal reserves that Russia controls are a power that was built with blood, money, many tears and ecological changes but due to the decrease in coal consumption this power is getting less and less important. Nevertheless, these resources have helped Russia recover from the trauma of the fall of the soviet union and have helped it become the powerful country we now know it to be.

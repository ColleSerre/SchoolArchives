## Causes


## Important POT (points in time)

### Missouri compromise (1820)
Missouri wanted to enter the United States as a free state but that would tip the scales. This sparked a debate about wether congress should decide of free/slave states or if the people should decide. Missouri ended up becoming a slave state and Maine had to be a free state so the balance could be kept. From then on to 1854 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, all states north of latitude line 36,30 had to be free states. This included the Louisiana purchase territories.

### Kansas Nebraska Act & Bleeding Kansas

In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska act overturned the Missouri compromise to leave the decision of wether Kansas and Nebraska should be slave or free states to the people of the respective states. This led to a violent debate that divided the country as 91% of the opposition to this bill was northern. This led to what is called bleeding Kansas: two governments for the state emerged which plunged the people into confusion. One was pro-slavery and was backed by the democrats of Washington and the other was anti-slavery and backed by the Republicans of Washington. The standoff escalated into conflict as John Brown and his sons were fighting pro-slavery settlers and killed 5. The violence spread to senate when a senator from Massachusetts was nearly caned to death by a congressman from South Carolina. It is uncertain how many people died during these 2 bloody years but Kansas ended up joining the Union as a free state right before the civil war.

### Dred Scott's case (1846-1857)

Dred Scott was sold to a man who took him from Missouri to Wisconsin where he met his wife Harriet. The slave owner owned Dred, Harriet and their two children when he brought them back to Missouri. At that point, Dred and his wife filed freedom suits because they knew about a state court doctrine called "once free, always free". This meant that if they were held in a free state like Wisconsin it meant that they were free forever, even in a slave state. This led them to the supreme court who ruled three very important things:

1. Blacks had no rights in federal court
2. Slave states no longer had to honour "Once free, always free"
3. Congress never should have prohibited slavery in Wisconsin or in any state

This sparked a firestorm of controversy. The Scotts lost the case but won their freedom thanks to their supporters who bought them and freed them. 

### Uncle Tom's Cabin

Uncle Tom's Cabin was a novel published in a magazine between 1850 and 1851. Its book version sold more than 300,000. It resonated in the north and convinced many to take a real position on slavery

### Abraham Lincoln's Election

The Lincoln debates were a series of seven debates between Lincoln, part of the newly created Republican Party, and Stephen Douglas of the Democratic Party. They mainly discussed slavery in the United States. They made Lincoln a prominent figure of national politics and gain nomination for president in 1860 which burst outrage in the South. In November 6th 1860 Abraham Lincoln won the presidential election without the support of any southern states. Therefore, **he wasn't considered relevant by the South.**

### South Carolina Secession

After the election of Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina followed by 11 "cotton states" over 6 months created their own Federal Government: *the confederates states of America*. The Confederates launched an attack on *Fort Sumter* in April 1860. This led to Lincoln calling on all states to send forces to recapture federal properties.

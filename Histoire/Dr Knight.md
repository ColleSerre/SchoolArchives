## The Great Depression

### The Wall Street Crash

Greatest economic catastrophy in recent history
Wall St = most financial companies are
The crisis caused major changes in the American way of life and had an influence in Hitler's rise to power.

After the 1st World War, immensely rich New Yorkers lived the "roaring twenties" which inspired F Scott Fitzgerald *The Great Gatsby*.

The production of steel can be used as a proxy to show American industrial development. Coal and oil can also be used as proxies. 

Mass production of cars allows them to be more accessible to the masses. People start using these cars to enjoy leisure (the beach/countryside). The working class American can now afford what used to be luxury leisure. 

#### Causes

* **Speculation**
	* Stock market speculation
		* 1920: 4 million shareholders
		* 1929: 20 million shareholders
		* (US population 120 million)
	* What is speculation ? → Investing with a lot of risk 
	* Buying shares "on margin": pay 10% cash and borrow the rest → led to banks failing because people were losing money with stocks
	* "Speculate to accumulate"

The perceived health of the stock market is high, which led to a massive increase in the number of shares being traded. 

``The stock market hysteria reached its apex that year [1929]... Everyone was playing the market... On my last day in New York, I went down to the barber. As he removed the sheet he said softly, 'Buy Standard Gas. I've doubled . . . It’s good for another double. ' As I walked upstairs, I suspected that if the hysteria had reached the barber level, something must soon happen.``

Cecil Roberts, The Bright Twenties, 1938

**Weaknesses in the US economy**

* Farming - overproduction. Market saturation, selling the products didn't cover the costs of production. 
* Decline in construction (since 1926), it reached a plateau after WW1
* Industry - overproduction
* Tariffs
	* Prevent Imports by taxing them
	* Europe retaliated to imposing tariffs on US products (trade war)
* Unequal distribution of wealth

### The Crash

Black Thursday: 24 October 1929

The year 1920 was a speculative bubble which burst on Black Thursday. People who didn't speculate lost everything too. The Dow Jones snowballed into the crash. US unemployment reaches a high in 1923 (24.9 % of Americans are unemployed).

### The Dust Bowl

1930-1941: A U.S. Weather Bureau scientist called the drought of the 1930s "the worst in the climatological history of the country."  Conditions were especially severe in the southern plains, where farming on marginal land threatened the environment even before the drought struck. As farm families migrated west on Route 66, the federal government began a series of massive building projects that provided flood control, irrigation, electric power, and transportation facilities to residents of the states of the Far West. 

The over farming that took place in the 30s, combined with long summers and droughts (and of course the Great Depression),  this was a triple (quadruple) catastrophe for farmers. They left their farms and equipment on site which gave the places a deserted look.

Hooverville was the name of a slum in Seattle (1937). It was named after President Herbert Hoover. 

### 1932 Presidential Election

* Hoover; "do nothing" president ?
	* Tax cuts 1930 & 1931 
	* Reconstruction Finance Company - supported banks
	* Tariffs
* Hoover opposed to social security
	* Relief should be provided by local government and charities NOT the federal government
* Bonus Army Marches, June 1932 - Hoover refused to meet ex-soldiers

Roosevelt -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt

* "Active government" to improve the life of ordinary people
* Use government to get people back to work
* Consulted widely: factory owners, union leaders, economist
* Vague promises of a 'New Deal'

### New Deal

Massive program that FDR launched. The three Rs: **Relief, Recovery and Reform**. Trying to get the economy on its feet, reform the socio-economic system to prevent another Great Depression. 

### Keynesian economics

Sir John Maynard Keynes

* Critic of Versailles Treaty
* Government action can foster full employment and stimulate the economy
* Managed market economy - predominantly private sector, but with an active role for **government intervention during recessions and depressions**. 
* Laissez faire

The type of federal budget that took place in 1932 is characteristic of a war which shows the magnitude of the crisis.

**The Hundred Days**

* Emergency Banking Act & Securities Exchange Commission
* Federal Emergency Relief Administration
* Civilian Conservation Corps
* Agricultural Adjustment Administration
* National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA)
* Public Works Administration
* National Recovery Administration (NRA)
* "fireside chats" - every Sunday. 60 million people tuned in

### Tennessee Valley Authority 

Major infrastructure project. Example of Keynesianism.

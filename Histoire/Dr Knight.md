## The Great Depression

### The Wall Street Crash

Greatest economic catastrophy in recent history
Wall St = most financial companies are
The crisis caused major changes in the American way of life and had an influence in Hitler's rise to power.

After the 1st World War, immensely rich New Yorkers lived the "roaring twenties" which inspired F Scott Fitzgerald *The Great Gatsby*.

The production of steel can be used as a proxy to show American industrial development. Coal and oil can also be used as proxies. 

Mass production of cars allows them to be more accessible to the masses. People start using these cars to enjoy leisure (the beach/countryside). The working class American can now afford what used to be luxury leisure. 

#### Causes

* **Speculation**
	* Stock market speculation
		* 1920: 4 million shareholders
		* 1929: 20 million shareholders
		* (US population 120 million)
	* What is speculation ? → Investing with a lot of risk 
	* Buying shares "on margin": pay 10% cash and borrow the rest → led to banks failing because people were losing money with stocks
	* "Speculate to accumulate"

The perceived health of the stock market is high, which led to a massive increase in the number of shares being traded. 

``The stock market hysteria reached its apex that year [1929]... Everyone was playing the market... On my last day in New York, I went down to the barber. As he removed the sheet he said softly, 'Buy Standard Gas. I've doubled . . . It’s good for another double. ' As I walked upstairs, I suspected that if the hysteria had reached the barber level, something must soon happen.``

Cecil Roberts, The Bright Twenties, 1938

**Weaknesses in the US economy**

* Farming - overproduction. Market saturation, selling the products didn't cover the costs of production. 
* Decline in construction (since 1926), it reached a plateau after WW1
* Industry - overproduction
* Tariffs
	* Prevent Imports by taxing them
	* Europe retaliated to imposing tariffs on US products (trade war)
* Unequal distribution of wealth

### The Crash

Black Thursday: 24 October 1929

The year 1920 was a speculative bubble which burst on Black Thursday. People who didn't speculate lost everything too. The Dow Jones snowballed into the crash. US unemployment reaches a high in 1923 (24.9 % of Americans are unemployed).

### The Dust Bowl

1930-1941: A U.S. Weather Bureau scientist called the drought of the 1930s "the worst in the climatological history of the country."  Conditions were especially severe in the southern plains, where farming on marginal land threatened the environment even before the drought struck. As farm families migrated west on Route 66, the federal government began a series of massive building projects that provided flood control, irrigation, electric power, and transportation facilities to residents of the states of the Far West. 

The over farming that took place in the 30s, combined with long summers and droughts (and of course the Great Depression),  this was a triple (quadruple) catastrophe for farmers. They left their farms and equipment on site which gave the places a deserted look.

Hooverville was the name of a slum in Seattle (1937). It was named after President Herbert Hoover. 

### 1932 Presidential Election

* Hoover; "do nothing" president ?
	* Tax cuts 1930 & 1931 
	* Reconstruction Finance Company - supported banks
	* Tariffs
* Hoover opposed to social security
	* Relief should be provided by local government and charities NOT the federal government
* Bonus Army Marches, June 1932 - Hoover refused to meet ex-soldiers

Roosevelt -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt

* "Active government" to improve the life of ordinary people
* Use government to get people back to work
* Consulted widely: factory owners, union leaders, economist
* Vague promises of a 'New Deal'

### New Deal

Massive program that FDR launched. The three Rs: **Relief, Recovery and Reform (short term, middle term, long term)**. Trying to get the economy on its feet, reform the socio-economic system to prevent another Great Depression. 

### Keynesian economics

Sir John Maynard Keynes

* Critic of Versailles Treaty
* Government action can foster full employment and stimulate the economy
* Managed market economy - predominantly private sector, but with an active role for **government intervention during recessions and depressions**. 
* Laissez faire

The type of federal budget that took place in 1932 is characteristic of a war which shows the magnitude of the crisis.

**The Hundred Days**

* Emergency Banking Act & Securities Exchange Commission
* Federal Emergency Relief Administration
* Civilian Conservation Corps
* Agricultural Adjustment Administration
* National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA)
* Public Works Administration
* National Recovery Administration (NRA)
* "fireside chats" - every Sunday. 60 million people tuned in

### Tennessee Valley Authority or TVA

Major federal infrastructure project (Reform). Example of Keynesianism. Trying to put people back to work (Recovery). Promoted the raw material industry (steel, concrete). Gave people hydroelectric electricity (Relief). 

### Why were the Hundred days important ? 

See drive

### The Second New Deal

See drive
Security and Exchange Commission (SEC): regulates the stock market 
Soil Conservation Act: "To provide for the protection of land resources against soil erosion, and for other purposes” 

### New Deal Criticism

-   The New Deal was complicated and there were too many codes and regulations. 
-   Government should not support trade unions an d it should not support calls for higher wages - the market should deal with these issues.
-   Schemes such as the TVA created unfair competition for private companies.
-   The New Deal schemes were like the economic plans being carried out in the Communist USSR and unsuitable for the democratic, free-market USA.
-   Roosevelt was behaving like a dictator.
-   The wealthy were wealthy because they had worked hard and used their abilities. High taxes discouraged people from working hard and gave money to people for doing nothing or doing unnecessary jobs.

## Great Depression in France - The Popular Front and the Matignon Accords


Popular Front: A coalition of left, extreme-left wing parties and centre parties. They were made to combat the rising threat of Nazism and fascism. 

The threat of fascism in France in 1937 was very real (nationalist leagues). 

### Matignon aAccords: c

Created the French social contract and,

* 40 hour long week
* Collective bargaining
* Paid holidays

### Crisis in France

France and Belgium were hit later by the 1929 crisis because France was less industrialized and therefore relied less on exports. France was less in debt than other countries. Its bankruptcies "only" doubled between 1929 & 1935 where the US increased 5 times. It lasted longer than in the US and exacerbated political instability of the Third Republic. 

Unemployment in France was *relatively* low because foreign workers were sent back to their home countries and French workers from rural origins returned to their native farms. This created problems because polish workers, which were the ones mostly working the mines, were forcefully returned to their countries. Unfortunately, the northern mines were low on workers because a lot of working class people had died during WW1.  

### Radicalization of politics

The political system in France & Germany is discredited which led to many people turning back from the "middle ground" towards extreme parties. 

### February 6th 1934 Crisis

Several individuals were killed when several extreme right leagues protested against parliament. Some think this was an attempt to overthrow parliament. After this crisis, the government resigned (Daladier). This shows the rise of fascists as Hitler was already in power since 1933. Many thought that what happened in Germany would soon happen in France. 

### The Popular Front

Contre la misère, la guerre et le fascisme. 
"Donner du pain aux travailleurs, du travail à la jeunesse, et la paix au monde"

"L'homme est à fusiller, mais dans le dos. C'est en tant que juif qu'il faut voir, concevoir, entrevoir, combattre et abattre le Blum" - Charles Maurras 

"Blum was confronted from the outset with a wave of anti-Semitism such as France had not seen since the days of the Dreyfus Affair." - William Shirer

**11 % of communists in parliament in 1936 (72 seats)**

### Joyous strikes

Simone Weil: philosopher, holocaust survivor
Outpouring of joy, previous parliaments and governments were more hostile regarding strikes. 

### Matignon Accords (1936)

* 40 hours work week (equivalent to a day off for some)
* Paid holidays for workers - 2 weeks
* Salary increases: 7-15%
* Collective bargaining (the legal right for unions to negotiate with corporations on behalf of the workers)
* National Grain Office
* Bank of France - government control
* Nationalizations
* Compulsory education → 14 years
* Public Works Program
* 133 laws in 73 days 
* SNCF: Nationalization of all railway companies

### Were the measures taken by the FP a french "New Deal" ? 
**Difference of scale:** New Deal was earlier, longer and bigger
**Different causes:** New Deal was born to solve a crisis, FP was born to fight agains fascism (which was growing due to the 1929 crash & the great depression)
**Different continuity:** The New Deal "continued" during the second world war whereas the Matignon accords were terminated by the Vichy government. 

## The Soviet Union under Stalin - Idology, terror and modernisation

**What is the difference between totalitarianism and authoritarianism ? (See diagram on Google Slides)** 

Authoritarianism limit political freedom whereas totalitarianism tend to limit individual liberty as a whole. 
Totalitarian states are guided by an ideology whereas authoritarian states don't necessarily start off with an ideology. In a totalitarian state, the ideology and the leader become one through a cult of personality. The word cult denotes the prophet/godlike figure the person becomes. You need to perform, to show your enthusiasm for the leader. 

Totalitarianism: A form of government that permits little or no freedom and seeks to subordinate all aspects of the individual's life to the authority of the state. An essential feature is its basis on a mass movement and that it seeks 'to rule from the inside out'. (The public and private become blurred

Authoritarianism: Wants compliance from their citizens and to stay in power. 

### Ideology

**Communism:** Political ideology that attempts to establish a perfectly equal society, without social classes, without a state, and without private property. Worldwide proletarian revolution

**Stalinism:** A form of Communism led by Stalin: totalitarianism and terror

* Cult of personality: Stalin
* "Socialism in one country": instead of worldwide proleterian revolution, build a classless society in the Soviet Union (despite hostile "capitalist encirclement"). 

### New Economic Policy

* Output: 1921, 17% of 1913
* Shortage of grain & manufactured goods
	* Hyperinflation
* March 1921: 'New Economic Policy'
	* Private/local enterprise permitted
	* 'commanding heights' of the economy under state control: banking, heavy industry, transportation, international trade
	* 1927: output = prewar levels

### Joseph Stalin

Cult of personality

Five year plans:
* 1928-1940: Industrial output grew 4x
* Iron, steel, coal, electrical power, tractors, railways, etc
* 1939: Soviet Union = 3rd (US and Germany 1st and 2nd)
* Capital raised from grain

Modernisation of Agriculture (industry and agriculture, two sides of the same coin, statue):

* Private ownership: *kulaks* - relatively wealthy peasants, leased land out, owned multiple plots of land (4%)
* Grain shortages in cities
* rapid industrialization
* Collectivization of agriculture:
	* Produce grain for food and export
	* Free peasant labor for factories
* Elimination of kulaks
* Forced collectivization

#### Collectivization

* Famines 1932-1933
* 1934: 75% of farms collectivized
* Millions of peasants & kulaks opposed to collectivization: arrested, deported, land confiscated
* 100 million horses and cattle slaughtered by peasants
* 10 million peasants killed
* 1928: 98% land = small holdings
* 1938: 90% land = collectivized
* This was a great failure as the output of grain, cattle, pigs, sheep and goats all decreased. 
* Agricultural modernization was a complete failure compared to the modernization of industry which was outstanding

Cf. case study on the Ukranian famine 

#### Great purges

* Opposition to Socialization of Economy
* Great Purges
* Arrests, murders, torture, show trials, executions, deportations, long prison sentences.
* Communist Party
* Red Army – officer corps
* 1939: Purges stopped
* 10-11 million dead

## Fascism in Germany: Adolf Hitler

Hitler jailed in 1923 after a failed uprising (New York Times: "Hitler tamed by prison")

Fascism did not have a clear founding doctrine, and it manifested itself differently in different countries. In general, Fascism promoted nationalisme, a strong leader or dictator, one-party government, empire building and war. Nevertheless, it could be argued that it is easier to understand what Fascism was by considering what it stood against: it was anti-communist and against the class struggle, against internationalism, against multi-party liberal democracy and against pacifism. (Roger & Thomas, *Move to Global War, 2015* p.89)

**Fascism:**

* Communism is deeply internationalist whereas Fascism is nationalist
* Promotion of state violence and the belief that violence is necessary for progress
* Social darwinism: justifying social, geopolitical inequality with pseudo-scientific theories (a very popular idea throughout Europe)
* Social unity, going away with class warfare. Everyone is united through race and nation (opposite of Communism: all proletariates are united beyond nations). 

**National Socialism:**

* Union of all Germans in a greater Germany
* Revocation of the Treaty of Versailles (enormous reparations, lost territory, can't have a large military, war guilt clause)
* Gaining territories to accommodate surplus German production: Lebensraum - "living space"
* Restriction of state citizenship to those of German blood
* Jews to be denined membership of the Volksgemeinschaft
* Aryans have led the advacement of the Human race throughout History against Jews (since the Antiquity)

Instead of working to achieve power by an armed coup we shall have to hold our noses and enter the Reichstag against the Catholic and Marxist deputies. If out-voting them takes longer than outshooting them, at least the results will be guaranteed by their own constitution ! Any lawful process is slow. Sooner or later we will have a majority, and after that - Germany. (A possible comment by Hilter to one of the Nazi Party's backers 1924. *After his prison time*)

### Germany: Weimar Republic

* 1919: new government convened in Weimar
* July 1919: New German constitution
* Reparations: $33 Billion
* Inflation
	* 1914: 4.2 reichmarks/$
	* 1921: 270 reichmarks/$
	* Sept. 1923: 100m reichmarks/$
	* Oct. 1923: 1 trillion reichmarks/$
	* Nov. 1923: 4.2 trillion reichmarks/$
* 1923: Default on payments -> France & Belgium occupied Ruhr (for coal)
* During the German inflation of 1923, currency was worth more to burn as fuel than to use as money

### Spirit of Locarno

* August 1923: Gustav Stressmann - new Chancellor
	- Stabilized currency
	- Renegociated reparations payments
* 1925: French & Belgium troops left the Ruhr
* 1925 Treaties of Locarno: Germany recognized the borders of France & Belgium and accepted the demilitarization of the Rhineland
* 1926: Germany entered League of Nations
* Centered on the Western states
* Massive inflow of capital from the US (in the form of loans)
* Modernization of German industry (helped by Ford and General Motors)
* 1923-1928: GDP +50% / 9% p.a
* Germany is second in steel output (first is USA), Coal output has exceeded pre-war levels (1928)
* European powers wanted a powerful Germany against the Soviet Union
* **Things are looking good for Germany, this discredits the straight line between WW1, Treaty of Versailles, economic crisis, nazism, Hitler**
* However, nazism, the versailles treaty didn't go away, the NSDAP held 32 seats in parliament in 1924

### Rise of the Nazis (National Socialist)

* 1929: Great Depression
* Massive unemployment (especially in youth ; this massively decreased when Hitler reached power)
* 50% decline in industrial production
* Parliament deadlocked
* Increase in extreme parties
* Increase in nazi Sturmabteilung (SA)
* Unemployment and Nazi vote share are correlated

* "The Nazi vote was above all a protest vote" - Richard J. Evans *The Coming of the Third Reich*, 2003, p. 448 (did people who voted for the Nazi party vote for ideas or against something else?)

### Hitler takes over

* July 1932 elections: 37% vote - 230 seats
* Nov. 1932 elections: 33% vote - 196 seats
* Jan. 1933: Hitler appointed Chancellor

### Reichstag fire & the enabling act

* 27 February 1933: Reichstag burnt down
* Enabling Act: rule by decree (i.e. without approval of parliament)
	*  SA/SS violence
	* 2/3 majority required - supported by the Centre Party

### Elimination of Rivals

* SA (Sturmabteilung) Storm Stroopers: 1 million members - mainly ex-soldiers
	* Para-military wing of the party
	* Commanded by Ernst Rohm (major rival)
* 30 June 1934: Night of the Long Knives
	* Rohm & other SA officers murdered (c. 200)
	* He didn't need a para-military group since he was now head of State and of the military
	* Pleased the military
* Aug. 1934: President Hindenburg died
	* Hitler -> Chancellor & President = Fuhrer --- The Leader
	* Plebiscite: 84% approval

## US Home Front During WW2
### Women in WW2

"Arsenal of Democracy" - FDR, 29/12/1940

Working women during WW2 were depicted in propaganda as systematically linked to a man and as replacements for men. "Anything except heavy lifting and combat. They could try" - Major Ruth Cheney Streeter

-   Women officers could not command men
-   Women could not undertake combat
-   Mainly clerical, communications, and health care.
-   Only WAC and nurses served overseas.

-   Before war: young & single
-   75% new workers married
-   60% over 35
-   33% had children under 14
-   Earned 65% of male salaries
-   Women gave up jobs for returning men

On one hand, the war effort allowed women to work in manual jobs and to some extent were emancipated. On the other hand, their role was always to free up a man to join the fight and were never pushed to the actual front. This means that gender hierarchy was reinforced.

### AAs during WW2

**Executive order 8802, Prohibition of Discrimmination in the Defense Industry (June 1941)**

`"There shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries and in Government, because of race, creed, color, or national origin"`

**Double V campaign:** Victory over racism in the US and over the Axis

Average wages during WW2: AA: $457 -> $1,967 ; White Americans: $1,064 -> $2,600
Like women, parity was never achieved

* 700,000 - 1 million AAs served in the military
* Segregated military units
* Marine Corps first refused to accept any AAs
	* Mostly assigned to non-combat roles or defense (cf. quote on slide 28)
* Officers: 1940: 5 ; 1945: over 7000
Although this data shows that progress was made, it took place in a systemicly racist system. 

### Japanese-Americans internment

* EO 9066: **removal of all JAs living on the West-Coast**
* 1942: 112,000 JAs sent to internment camps. **2/3 were born in America**
* Approved by the Supreme Court
* "A Jap's a Jap, It makes no difference wether he is an American citizen or not."
* Cf. videos on slide
* ** Why did the JAs got imprisoned and not GAs ? They looked different.** 

## US Atomic Bombing of Japan

-   1894-5: China-Japan War
-   1902: Alliance with Britain: first ever military pact concluded on equal terms between a western and non-western power
-   1904: Russia-Japan War: First victory of a non-western nation over a western nation
-   1904-1910: Occupation and Annexation of Korea
-   1937-1945: Sino-Japanese War

### Historiography: the study of how interpretations of the past change
Two interpretations:

1. Save (American) lives
	1. Japanese refused **unconditional** surrender
2. Cold War deterrent
	1. It had nothing to do with Japan or military necessity
	2. Was fueled by the US's geo-strategic motives to demonstrate to the Soviet Union
	3. Wanted to make sure that Japan was not only defeated but also humilitated (like France with Germany after WW1)
	4. Started to break the "marriage of convinience" between USSR and US
3. Additional motives
	1. Use bomb to justify time and money spent
	2. Test new weapon
	3. Revenge for Pearl Harbor
	4. Revenge for mistreatment of allied war prisoners
	5. Racism

End of the war in Europe -> USSR troops massively move to the Eastern front (Invasion of Manchuria: race to Japan)

### Total war & Strategic bombing: Everyone is a target (civilians are targets because they made weapons)

Tactical bombing: bombs used to destroy specific targets (factories, military facilities)
Strategic bombing: bomb until winning the war (bombs are the essential component of the war strategy)

## The Holocaust

"The Final Solution": comprehensive program to exterminate the entire Jewish population
The Decision:

* Incremental process: policy evolved over time
* June 1941: **Operation Barbarossa** - German invasion of Soview Union 
	* Poland/Soviet Union to be used for expansion of the German 'race' - 'liebesraum' ('living space')
* "Final solution" decision: autumn 1941 - beginning 1942
	* Early victories against USSR: Hitler thought the war was won
	* Later losses again the USSR and entry of the US into war: Hitler believed the war was lost → **He had to win the racial war**, although he was going to lose the military war
* Upto mid-October 1941: Deporting Jews to the "east" (e.g. Siberia) for slave labour and decimation
* Until then: expulsion and extermination (Operation Reinhard)
* Mass of the Holocaust (2 million jews) were killed by Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht 
* 3 programs were **already** in place:
	* Deportation
	* Concentration  Camps
	* Gas Chambers - used for "euthanasia" program (Aktion T4)
* **Ghettos**

### Total War & Totalitarian Regimes: the war of annihalitation in Eastern Europe

* Both totalitarian regimes wanted to annihalate each other
* Large population of jews in the USSR and necessity to expand "lebesraum" to the East (Yale interview of Timothy Snyder)

Two thesis:
1. The German were naturally anti-semitic (conceptions of religion)
2. Peer pressure, obedience, propaganda and dehumanisation, war and brutalization (Christopher R. Browning) (Reserve Police Battalion 101)

# Emergence of the Cold War - The Messy Divorce (CWar beginning)

Berlin blockade & airlift : divorce finalized
Bretton woods conference (July 1944): IMF, IBRD, against protectionism & tariffs, USD is the world's currency, US dominated the proceedings
June 1945: UN Conference - San Francisco
51 States unanimously agreed UN charter
UN Security Council --> "Big Five" permanent members (veto power)
Promote human rights (problematic institution)
**War trials:** supr-national institutions keep leaders who commit crimes against humanity from getting away (IMT)
Victor's justice: the allies set up the court, the rules of the court and appointed the judges to the court (double standards ? the bombing of civilians and cities wasn't considered a war crime)
Stalin wanted "Defense in depth" (Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area)
Truman Doctrine (March 1947): 
- Soviet Union was refuses joint supervision of straits by turkey
- Stop the spread of communism (domino theory)
- First major cold war act of the US : Greek CW between authoritarian gov (backed by UK) and KKE (backed by USSR). KKE defeated

Main events: 
- **Truman doctrine and containment**
- **Berlin Blockade & Airlift**
- **Korean War**

## Berlin crisis
The alies had calved Germany in 4 different zones (Soviet, French, British and US). The allies unified Western Germany to act as a buffer zone agains the Soviet Union, became a federal republic (capital: Bonn), new constitution (west germany only), unified currency between allied zones. 
Soviet Union: didn't want unified Germany, had suffered greatly during WW2 and didn't want a strong power supported by the West (+ ideological reason: against imperialism). Stalin held Berlin hostage to stop the allies from unifying Germany, closed air corridors and roads. This failed due to the response from the allies: **the Berlin airlift** (300 days). As a result of the Berlin crisis, US, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, UK, France, Portugal, Italy formed NATO (mutual defense, the US now had bases that held SU in B29 nuclear bombing range).
Nuclearisation of the Cold war (see S30)

## Korean war

Occupied by Japan since beginning of 20th century, annexed in 1910. Occupied by both US and SU after WW2, both forces withdrew. DPRK: North Korea (Communist state), Soviet advice, 1M Koreans fled south / ROK: South Korea (US supported). Both Korean governments wanted to unify Korea. NK forces invaded South with Soviet and Chinese support (in an effort to unify the peninsula ?). NK took all of the peninsula, UN forces (US backed) beat NK all the way to the Chinese border, China pushed SK back to the 38th parallel.
Why didn't the SU or Chine veto the resolution ?

# Zionism & the creation of Israël

**Zionism:** a jewish movement that sought to create a state for their community. Jews are considered a national community entitled to their own independent state. Combining Judaism and nationalism (religion and political ideology)

Zionism emerged at the end of the 19th century (Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern zionism reacted to the Dreyfus affair. Wanted to carve out a jewish state in the Ottoman Empire, Palestine was in the OE and jews were a minority there. However, Herzl might have felt entitled to conquer an area already occupied by POC as a white man in an imperialist world)

British support for Zionism: Nov 1917 --> Balfour Declaration (foreign secretary) supports a "Jewish national home in Palestine" while protecting "civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine" (**Dual obligation**)

What as supposed to happen to the 499k Palestinians ? Jewish state was ~50/50 Palestinians/Jews
Palestinian talking points: Jewish state was given more land + better land (Haifa: major port and the industrial centre, most fertile and lucrative areas), fundamentally immoral to partition a country against the will of the majority of the population, Zionism is a response to a *european problem*: anti-semitism.

**1st Arab-Israel War (May-October 1948):** Israelis defended and expanded their territory against 6 countries, Israel won. 

**US & Israel:** US recognised Israel within 11 minutes of it being proclaimed:
- Sympathy for the plight of the Jews during the Holocause ? (a bit, yeah but...)
- Next presidential election coming up --> big jewish diaspora in the US (the "Jewish vote")
- Pre-empt SU

## Suez Crisis

India was the center of the british empire (jewel of the crown), the british wanted to get there faster, the Suez canal allowed that. Much of british middle east policy is, therefore, linked to the canal. When Egypt went bankrupt due to the loans it took out for the Suez canal, the country was in a pre-revolutionary time, Britain therefore invaded it (were supposed to just restore order, stayed 70 years). 

Non-aligned movement: played both sides to fit their agenda (Nasser was part of it)

Nasser: get rid of the British, the monarchy and ...

**compléter cours du 19/01**

## China, Mao Zedhong, and the Cold War

### Maoism and 1962 Sino-Spvoet split

Mao was opposed to Kruchchev's criticism of Stalin (destalinization). Instead of building huge industrial power, he focused on agricultural production and developing industry at a smaller level in rural areas (Great Leap Forward). 

Taiwan was occupied by Nationalists, it was used by US fleet during the Korean War. 

## Vietnam warS
* First V war (1946-1954) or French Indochina war
* Second V war (1954-1963)
Second Vietnam war ended in 1975 but Theme 3 talks about 1963-1975
**First war**
Part of the French Empire since mid-19th
* Second world war: Vichy surrendered Indochina to Japan
* Viet Minh: league for the Independence of V, mainly communists, resistance against Japan, led by Ho Chi Minh, supported by US, Japan surrendered 
* Communist but more nationalist than commie
* Declared independence in 1945
* WW2 led to surprising alliances
* Quoted the US declaration of independence in declaration of independence to get the US on their side (extending his hand towards the US)
* France got freed from an imperialist regime (Nazi germany) but clinged to be imperialist in Indochina
* First layer: Nationalist movement wants to break free from colonial domination (began similarly to Nasser in Egypt with the UK, shares some similarities with Mao's nationalism + Communist Chinia assisted Viet Minh). Asymetric warfare (guerilla)
* Second layer: the Cold War
	* When communist china assisted the Viet Minh, the US flipped from being neutral regarding the movement and not particularly supportive of France regaining control of V to basically bank rolling France during the war. 
	* Decisive battle: Dien Bien Phu
* Geneva Accords: temporarily divided V @ 17th parallel, north: HCM, south: Ngo Dinh Diem
* Elections in 1956 to unify the country
* SEATO: not very south-east asian except for Thailand and Philippines (2/6)
**Second war**
* North: supported by the SU & CC (Democratic Republic of Vietnam)
* South: Ngo Dinh Diem (Authoritarian & corrupt), cancelled 1956 elections (knew he'd lose ?), Republic of Vietnam
* 1958: Unrest in S. Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh calling upon those who oppose Ngo Dinh Diem)
* 1959: start of the construction of the future "Ho Chi Minh Trail" (From N to S through Laos and Cambodia)
* 1960: National Front for the Liberation of the South (NLF), established in the S by the N
* PLAF: People's Liberation Army Forces (Viet Cong)

### Growing US involvment & escalation
* Kennedy, 20 April 1961: The concern is what is happening inside the countries, and the threat of war cause by this, that matters. 
* "Advisors": US soldiers engaging and operating with the SV army. Started by Eisenhower and expanded by Kennedy
* Sent military equipment: jet fighters, helis, armored personnel carriers, river patrol boats, napalm (although not used yet), Agent Orange (used to kill crops, led to cancer, blindness, congenital diseases)
* Position got nuances compared to 20 April
	* Battle of Ap Bac (humiliating defeat for the SV, **while US advisors were on site**)
	* "Buddhist Crisis": Buddhists demonstrated against Ngo Dinh Diem favouring catholics in gov, police opened fire (killing 8)
	* 11 June 1963: Quang Duc (Buddhist monk) suicide
* Kennedy, September 1963: ambivolent, it's their war, they should win it, but we have to stay
* 2 November 1963: Ngo Dinh Diem - coup & assassinated
* 22 November 1963: Kennedy assassinated

## Castro, Cuba, and the Cuban Missile Crisis

* US Neo-Imperialism
	* 75% arable land
	* 90% essential services
	* 40% sugar production
	* Platt amendment
	* FDR (1934): Good Neighbor Policy
* 1952-1959: Fulgencio Batista (dictator and president of Cuba)

	* Cubans bombed Cuban air bases with 3 US planes
	* Trained and equipped Cuban counterrevolutionaries
	* Landed them in the Bay of Pigs
	* Easily defeated and captured by Castro's forces
	* Supposed to spark a revolution
	* This agression led to Castro asking help from the SU who stationned nuclear missiles in Cuba
* Cuban missile crisis (13 days)
	* US missiles in Italy and Turkey
	* In response to Bay of pigs --> USSR built missiles in Cuba
	* Up to that point, the conflict was in Europe. Cuba is 150 km away from Florida
	* "Quarantine" around Cuba, not a blockade = not an act of war, only prevented military supplies from entering the perimeter
	* DEFCON 2: Denfense readiness condition (finger is on the trigger, western armies will be ready in 6 hours to invade the USSR)
	* Robert Kennedy, JFK's brother and DC attorney general, negociated with the Soviets
	* Removal of nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey and promise not to invade Cuba <=> removal of Soviet missiles in Cuba

## Oil and Political Islam

### October 1973: Arab-Israeli war & the first oil crisis

* Organisations
	* OPEP: Organisation des pays exportateurs de pétrole (OPEC in English)

	* Arab states use the "oil weapon" as leverage to get support against Israel
	* Anwar Sadat (Egypt) starts relations with the US and start a peace process, open up Egypt, modernize, break with Nasser's increasingly soviet ideas, and **free up the Suez canal**. 
	* Henry Kissinger: State secretary, wouldn't negociate with Sadat while Soviet "advisers" --> almost overnight 10k "advisers" left Egypt
	* Syria: usually the most rejectionist state regarding Israel (why?), willing to engage in some sort of peace process and with the Israelis (not directly but maybe throught the UN)
	* "Diplomacy of Attrition" - refuse to deal with Egypt and Syria's demands to start a diplomatic process (saw these demands from E and S as signs of weakeness from US and Israel). Made them desperate for a peace process --> push E and S  into a corner to comply to US and Israel peace terms. 
	* Carl von Clausewitz: "War is the continuation of politics by other means", 
	* **How a regional war became a Cold War**

* Build confidence and trust by making "small" agreements which will hopefully lead to "bigger" agreements
* 1974: Sinai I -  "Egyptian-Israeli Disengagement of Forces Agreement" (not a peace treaty)
* 
### 1979: Iranian revolution: political islam & the second oil crisis

* 1951: Muhammad Mossadeq PM --> wanted to reduce the Sha's power

### 1979: Soviet Invastion of Afghanistan: emergence of Islamic resistance

Attack of Ukraine shows that Russia has learned from the mistakes in Afghanistant (less instant attack 24th December)
Led to the rise of Islamic Resistance Movements

Detente (1967-1979): Nixon in China, Moscow, SALT I, Handshake in Space, SALT II, grain shipments to USSR

**Afghanistan:**
* 1973: Mohammed Daoud Khan overhrew monarche --> became a republic
* April 1978: Communists overthrew Khan
	* close ties with the SU
	* purges of domestic opposition
	* extensive land and social reform
* Opposition & Uprising
	* **Mujahideen** --> "one who undertakes jihad" (fighting for god), several groups, not always working together (rivalry between groups)
		* Anticommunist islamic guerillas
* Communist Party -- conflicts between two major/rival factions
SU Invasion: 30k-50k troops, killed afghan communist president, set up a soviet supported president, 100k-150k troops

WHY? 
* ~~Access to a warm water port...in Pakistan~~

US Response:
* US senate refused to ratify SALT II
* US banned grain exports to USSR
* US boycott of 1980 Moscow olympics
* Carter Doctrine
	* Supplied weapons and money to mujahadeen
beginning of fragmentation of Afghanistan 
CIA sent stinger missiles to mujahideen (Lithuania is currently sending the same weapons to Ukraine), this compromised the SU's air superiority and changed the nature of the war (context of the cold war --> SU = 'evil empire').

### From mujahideen to Talibans and Al-Qaeda (freedom fighters or terrorists ?)

**Gorbachev:** Afghanistan is a "bleeding wound", gave an extra year before withdrawl (eventually in 1989)
**Talibans:** extremist sunni islam organisation, does not seek to commit terrorism outside of Afghan borders (national movement) 
**Blowback:** unforeseen consequence of an action
**Al-Qaeda:** new concept for an organisation: trans-national jihad campaign, wanted an international conflict between believers and non-believers (it's argued that he was successful in this --> "war on terror")

### China & Deng Xiaoping

**turns back on Mao's legacy:** opening up the economy but not the political system, westernisation of exports
"better red than expert" v. "“No matter if it is a white cat or a black cat; as long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat."
ideological purity v. pragmatism
"let a part of the population get rich first" - Deng Xiaoping
**Four modernizations: agriculture, industry, science & tech, defense**

**SEZ (Special economic zones):** tax incentives & local autonomy to attract foreign investment, foreign investment & foreign ownership permitted, cheap labor

### Origins and evolution of the EU

"We must build a kind of United States of Europe" - Winston Churchill 1946
Origins: WW2, Benelux Union, Marshall Plan, Western European Union (fear of SU, 1948: Treaty of Brussels)
German problem: keep Germany weak or organically link (West) German economy to neighbors ? ECSC (Treaty of Paris) --> coal and steel production increased by 50% in the next 5 years. 

**Euro:** Buget deficit max: 3% GDP, inflation within 1.5% of three lowest members, Public debt ratio % of GDP

### End of the cold war & collapse of the soviet bloc

#### Gorbachev's reforms

* Perestroika
* Glasnost: response to the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and The Gulag Archipelago. Example: Wall of Sorrow 
* Democratisation: end of CPSU monopoly in the first congress of people's deputies, abolished reserved seats for communists, Boris Yeltsin was able to leave the Politburo, criticize it, and win in a run for office against the CPSU candidate afterwards (and not die)
* New thinking

Brezhnev doctrine: "None of their decisions should damage either socialism in their country or the fundamental interests of other socialists countries"

Sinatra doctrine (25/10/1989): "Every country decides on its own which road to take [...] political structures must be decided by the people who live there"

## The Great Depression

### The Wall Street Crash

Greatest economic catastrophy in recent history
Wall St = most financial companies are
The crisis caused major changes in the American way of life and had an influence in Hitler's rise to power.

After the 1st World War, immensely rich New Yorkers lived the "roaring twenties" which inspired F Scott Fitzgerald *The Great Gatsby*.

The production of steel can be used as a proxy to show American industrial development. Coal and oil can also be used as proxies. 

Mass production of cars allows them to be more accessible to the masses. People start using these cars to enjoy leisure (the beach/countryside). The working class American can now afford what used to be luxury leisure. 

#### Causes

* **Speculation**
	* Stock market speculation
		* 1920: 4 million shareholders
		* 1929: 20 million shareholders
		* (US population 120 million)
	* What is speculation ? → Investing with a lot of risk 
	* Buying shares "on margin": pay 10% cash and borrow the rest → led to banks failing because people were losing money with stocks
	* "Speculate to accumulate"

The perceived health of the stock market is high, which led to a massive increase in the number of shares being traded. 

``The stock market hysteria reached its apex that year [1929]... Everyone was playing the market... On my last day in New York, I went down to the barber. As he removed the sheet he said softly, 'Buy Standard Gas. I've doubled . . . It’s good for another double. ' As I walked upstairs, I suspected that if the hysteria had reached the barber level, something must soon happen.``

Cecil Roberts, The Bright Twenties, 1938

**Weaknesses in the US economy**

* Farming - overproduction. Market saturation, selling the products didn't cover the costs of production. 
* Decline in construction (since 1926), it reached a plateau after WW1
* Industry - overproduction
* Tariffs
	* Prevent Imports by taxing them
	* Europe retaliated to imposing tariffs on US products (trade war)
* Unequal distribution of wealth

### The Crash

Black Thursday: 24 October 1929

The year 1920 was a speculative bubble which burst on Black Thursday. People who didn't speculate lost everything too. The Dow Jones snowballed into the crash. US unemployment reaches a high in 1923 (24.9 % of Americans are unemployed).

### The Dust Bowl

1930-1941: A U.S. Weather Bureau scientist called the drought of the 1930s "the worst in the climatological history of the country."  Conditions were especially severe in the southern plains, where farming on marginal land threatened the environment even before the drought struck. As farm families migrated west on Route 66, the federal government began a series of massive building projects that provided flood control, irrigation, electric power, and transportation facilities to residents of the states of the Far West. 

The over farming that took place in the 30s, combined with long summers and droughts (and of course the Great Depression),  this was a triple (quadruple) catastrophe for farmers. They left their farms and equipment on site which gave the places a deserted look.

Hooverville was the name of a slum in Seattle (1937). It was named after President Herbert Hoover. 

### 1932 Presidential Election

* Hoover; "do nothing" president ?
	* Tax cuts 1930 & 1931 
	* Reconstruction Finance Company - supported banks
	* Tariffs
* Hoover opposed to social security
	* Relief should be provided by local government and charities NOT the federal government
* Bonus Army Marches, June 1932 - Hoover refused to meet ex-soldiers

Roosevelt -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt

* "Active government" to improve the life of ordinary people
* Use government to get people back to work
* Consulted widely: factory owners, union leaders, economist
* Vague promises of a 'New Deal'

### New Deal

Massive program that FDR launched. The three Rs: **Relief, Recovery and Reform (short term, middle term, long term)**. Trying to get the economy on its feet, reform the socio-economic system to prevent another Great Depression. 

### Keynesian economics

Sir John Maynard Keynes

* Critic of Versailles Treaty
* Government action can foster full employment and stimulate the economy
* Managed market economy - predominantly private sector, but with an active role for **government intervention during recessions and depressions**. 
* Laissez faire

The type of federal budget that took place in 1932 is characteristic of a war which shows the magnitude of the crisis.

**The Hundred Days**

* Emergency Banking Act & Securities Exchange Commission
* Federal Emergency Relief Administration
* Civilian Conservation Corps
* Agricultural Adjustment Administration
* National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA)
* Public Works Administration
* National Recovery Administration (NRA)
* "fireside chats" - every Sunday. 60 million people tuned in

### Tennessee Valley Authority or TVA

Major federal infrastructure project (Reform). Example of Keynesianism. Trying to put people back to work (Recovery). Promoted the raw material industry (steel, concrete). Gave people hydroelectric electricity (Relief). 

### Why were the Hundred days important ? 

See drive

### The Second New Deal

See drive
Security and Exchange Commission (SEC): regulates the stock market 
Soil Conservation Act: "To provide for the protection of land resources against soil erosion, and for other purposes” 

### New Deal Criticism

-   The New Deal was complicated and there were too many codes and regulations. 
-   Government should not support trade unions an d it should not support calls for higher wages - the market should deal with these issues.
-   Schemes such as the TVA created unfair competition for private companies.
-   The New Deal schemes were like the economic plans being carried out in the Communist USSR and unsuitable for the democratic, free-market USA.
-   Roosevelt was behaving like a dictator.
-   The wealthy were wealthy because they had worked hard and used their abilities. High taxes discouraged people from working hard and gave money to people for doing nothing or doing unnecessary jobs.

## Great Depression in France - The Popular Front and the Matignon Accords


Popular Front: A coalition of left, extreme-left wing parties and centre parties. They were made to combat the rising threat of Nazism and fascism. 

The threat of fascism in France in 1937 was very real (nationalist leagues). 

Matignon accords: created the French social contract and,

* 40 hour long week
* Collective bargaining
* Paid holidays

### Crisis in France

France and Belgium were hit later by the 1929 crisis because France was less industrialized and therefore relied less on exports. France was less in debt than other countries. Its bankruptcies "only" doubled between 1929 & 1935 where the US increased 5 times. It lasted longer than in the US and exacerbated political instability of the Third Republic. 

Unemployment in France was *relatively* low because foreign workers were sent back to their home countries and French workers from rural origins returned to their native farms. This created problems because polish workers, which were the ones mostly working the mines, were forcefully returned to their countries. Unfortunately, the northern mines were low on workers because a lot of working class people had died during WW1.  

### Radicalization of politics

The political system in France & Germany is discredited which led to many people turning back from the "middle ground" towards extreme parties. 

### February 6th 1934 Crisis

Several individuals were killed when several extreme right leagues protested against parliament. Some think this was an attempt to overthrow parliament. After this crisis, the government resigned (Daladier). This shows the rise of fascists as Hitler was already in power since 1933. Many thought that what happened in Germany would soon happen in France. 

### The Popular Front

Contre la misère, la guerre et le fascisme. 
"Donner du pain aux travailleurs, du travail à la jeunesse, et la paix au monde"

"L'homme est à fusiller, mais dans le dos. C'est en tant que juif qu'il faut voir, concevoir, entrevoir, combattre et abattre le Blum" - Charles Maurras 

"Blum was confronted from the outset with a wave of anti-Semitism such as France had not seen since the days of the Dreyfus Affair." - William Shirer

**11 % of communists in parliament in 1936 (72 seats)**

### Joyous strikes

Simone Weil: philosopher, holocaust survivor
Outpouring of joy, previous parliaments and governments were more hostile regarding strikes. 

### Matignon Accords (1936)

* 40 hours work week (equivalent to a day off for some)
* Paid holidays for workers - 2 weeks
* Salary increases: 7-15%
* Collective bargaining (the legal right for unions to negotiate with corporations on behalf of the workers)
* National Grain Office
* Bank of France - government control
* Nationalizations
* Compulsory education → 14 years
* Public Works Program
* 133 laws in 73 days 
* SNCF: Nationalization of all railway companies

### Were the measures taken by the FP a french "New Deal" ? 
**Difference of scale:** New Deal was earlier, longer and bigger
**Different causes:** New Deal was born to solve a crisis, FP was born to fight agains fascism (which was growing due to the 1929 crash & the great depression)
**Different continuity:** The New Deal "continued" during the second world war whereas the Matignon accords were terminated by the Vichy government. 

## The Soviet Union under Stalin - Idology, terror and modernisation

**What is the difference between totalitarianism and authoritarianism ?** 

Authoritarianism limit political freedom whereas totalitarianism tend to limit individual liberty as a whole. 
Totalitarian states are guided by an ideology whereas authoritarian states don't necessarily start off with an ideology. In a totalitarian state, the ideology and the leader become one through a cult of personality. The word cult denotes the prophet/godlike figure the person becomes. 

Totalitarianism: A form of government that permits little or no freedom and seeks to subordinate all aspects of the individual's life to the authority of the state. An essential feature is its basis on a mass movement and that it seeks 'to rule from the inside out'. 

Authoritarianism: Wants compliance from their citizens and to stay in power.

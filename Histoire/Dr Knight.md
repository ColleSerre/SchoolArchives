The production of steel can be used as a proxy to show American industrial development. Coal and oil can also be used as proxies. 

Mass production of cars allows them to be more accessible to the masses. People start using these cars to enjoy leisure (the beach/countryside). The working class American can now afford what used to be luxury leisure. 

#### Causes

* **Speculation**
	* Stock market speculation
		* 1920: 4 million shareholders
		* 1929: 20 million shareholders
		* (US population 120 million)
	* What is speculation ? → Investing with a lot of risk 
	* Buying shares "on margin": pay 10% cash and borrow the rest → led to banks failing because people were losing money with stocks
	* "Speculate to accumulate"

The perceived health of the stock market is high, which led to a massive increase in the number of shares being traded. 

``The stock market hysteria reached its apex that year [1929]... Everyone was playing the market... On my last day in New York, I went down to the barber. As he removed the sheet he said softly, 'Buy Standard Gas. I've doubled . . . It’s good for another double. ' As I walked upstairs, I suspected that if the hysteria had reached the barber level, something must soon happen.``

Cecil Roberts, The Bright Twenties, 1938

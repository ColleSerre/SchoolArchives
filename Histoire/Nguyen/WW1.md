# Causes of WW1: long term, short term, spark

Rise of Slav nationalism + strengthening of national identities in France, GB and Spain:

* Within Austria-Hungary (there were many different people in the country, all wanted self-determination)
* Serbia's ambitions
* Russia's ambitions in the Balkans
* Clash of European imperialist ambitions 
	* French and British lead + weakening the Ottoman Empire (power vacuum)
	* Germany believed its place was in the sun
	* AH annexed Bosnia in 1908 
	* Russia
	* Serbia's ambitions "Yugoslavia"

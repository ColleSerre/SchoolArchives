# Causes of WW1: long term, short term, spark

Rise of Slav nationalism + strengthening of national identities in France, GB and Spain:

* Within Austria-Hungary (there were many different people in the country, all wanted self-determination)
* Serbia's ambitions
* Russia's ambitions in the Balkans
* Clash of European imperialist ambitions 
	* French and British lead + weakening the Ottoman Empire (power vacuum)
	* Germany believed its place was in the sun
	* AH annexed Bosnia in 1908 
	* Russia
	* Serbia's ambitions "Yugoslavia"
* Domestic troubles in AH & Russia, the war was a diversion and a way to restore the country's glory.  
Build up of European armies 
	* e.g: naval arms race between Germany and the UK
	* General mobilizations
* Role of leaders
* Alliances: defence / attack ?
* timing ?

Long term: 1870-1900
Short term: 1900-1914

* Military perspective:
	* Naval arms race (Germany: Second Naval Law in 1900 doubled the fleet, UK responded by developing the HMS Dreadnought)
	* German militarism (men & budget)
* Alliances
	* Triple Entente
	* Triplice

The British Empire with its alliances, and naval arms race with Germany was a decisive element in the start of WW1. Nonetheless, the rise of nationalism and the existing rivalries throughout Europe aren't to be neglected.

## Racial impact of WW1

The Great Migration: beginning of the 20th to end of 20s. Due to lack of jobs in the south, the African American population migrated massively to the north

During the war, instead of fighting under the American flag, the Harlem Hellfighters fought for France because the US saw the integration of black people in the army as a potential threat to white soldiers.

## Women

Replaced the men, worked in ammunition and weapons factories, agriculture, communications, volunteers overseas nurses. Women earning their own pay cheques, more interested in the right to vote. 1 million women joined the workforce during WW1. A lot of unpaid work: red cross, using less meat and wheat, the military (nursing showed that women were trained professionals). Virtually no opportunities for AA abroad. Served in the navy back home. Women always helped in wars but this time they were part of the military. **They were now in positions of power.** Changed the perspectives women could have. They were also used as propaganda, they were depicted as what men were protecting (along with children). **The war accelerated the loosening of the tie between women and the household.** This had long-lasting effects because it made women seem more capable, more in power and helped the women's suffrage movements.

| Differences | Similarities |
|--|--|
| AA did not get any legal improvements | Both groups were given economics opportunities |
| Women got the right to vote in 1920, 19th amendment.| both used war to promote and defend their rights and demonstrate their dignity |
|Women had a social gratitude, received medals and distinctions etc.| both requisitioned in war |
|War Proved women were trustworthy.|both faced limitations gender/stereotypes|
|War changed nothing about the look of American society about AA, with the red summer and the development of segregation during the following years.| Women and AA were involved for the first time in a national act |
| | Both expected to be acknowledged and rewarded for their contribution |
| | Both contributed overseas |


**All this demonstrates the lack of recognisance of people over AA but only over women.**

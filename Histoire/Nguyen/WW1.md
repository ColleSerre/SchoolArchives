# Causes of WW1: long term, short term, spark

Rise of Slav nationalism + strengthening of national identities in France, GB and Spain:

* Within Austria-Hungary (there were many different people in the country, all wanted self-determination)
* Serbia's ambitions
* Russia's ambitions in the Balkans
* Clash of European imperialist ambitions 
	* French and British lead + weakening the Ottoman Empire (power vacuum)
	* Germany believed its place was in the sun
	* AH annexed Bosnia in 1908 
	* Russia
	* Serbia's ambitions "Yugoslavia"
* Domestic troubles in AH & Russia, the war was a diversion and a way to restore the country's glory.  
Build up of European armies 
	* e.g: naval arms race between Germany and the UK
	* General mobilizations
* Role of leaders
* Alliances: defence / attack ?
* timing ?

Long term: 1870-1900
Short term: 1900-1914

* Military perspective:
	* Naval arms race (Germany: Second Naval Law in 1900 doubled the fleet, UK responded by developing the HMS Dreadnought)
	* German militarism (men & budget)
* Alliances
	* Triple Entente
	* Triplice

The British Empire with its alliances, and naval arms race with Germany was a decisive element in the start of WW1. Nonetheless, the rise of nationalism and the existing rivalries throughout Europe aren't to be neglected.

During the war, instead of fighting under the American flag, the Harlem Hellfighters fought for France because the US saw the integration of black people in the army as a potential threat to white soldiers.

## Women

Women earning their own pay cheques, more interested in the right to vote. 1 million women joined the workforce during WW1. A lot of unpaid work: red cross, using less meat and wheat, the military (nursing showed that women were trained professionals). Virtually no opportunities for AA abroad. Se

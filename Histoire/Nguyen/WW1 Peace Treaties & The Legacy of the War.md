# To what extent was the Treaty of Versailles justified ?

The treaty was anticipated to create a lot of resentment in Germany, but they did it anyway. War casualties: 22 million for Allies, 37.5 for Central Powers. Russia suffered the most (9 million casualties) followed by Germany (5.7 million). This led to a smaller working class in the two countries and a more difficult recovery. The Spanish flu caused 50-50 million death.

# To what extent was the Treaty of Versailles justified ?

The treaty was anticipated to create a lot of resentment in Germany, but they did it anyway. War casualties: 22 million for Allies, 37.5 for Central Powers. Russia suffered the most (9 million casualties) followed by Germany (5.7 million). This led to a smaller working class in the two countries and a more difficult recovery. The Spanish flu caused 50-50 million death. Trotsky negotiated peace with Germany. Roads, houses, and hospitals had to be rebuilt. Unexploded shells had to be handled. 
**The Russian Revolution: ** First Communist government formed in 1917. Winners torn between the need to punish those responsible for the war and keeping the world "*safe*" from communism. Besides, communism tends to spread on misery and the countries who were in the war were all miserable.

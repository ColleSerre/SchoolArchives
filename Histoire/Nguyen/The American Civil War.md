## Intro

The deadliest conflict in the history of the country
Still a source of controversy
Richmond was the capital of the Confederate states
Robert E. Lee: General for the Confederacy; his statue was removed by Florida but this was protested.
The Charlottesville riots, white suprematists protested against the removal of the statue. Anti-fa protesters protested against these demonstrations. This led to the Charlottesville car attack. 
Northern states: Union (blue uniforms) supported by the government
Southern states: Confederacy (grey uniforms) supported by some states

## North vs South

| North                                                                   | South                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Greater population (more soldier + larger labor force)                  | Slaves couldn't be in the army |
| More materials/weapons; better equipment (because of large labor force) |                                |
| Better supply network thanks to greater railroad mileage                |                                |

## The cotton gin

The invention of the cotton gin has allowed greater cotton production which satisfied the increasing demand and increased exports, profits which allowed to buy more fields and increased the need for slaves. 

## Statistics on slavery or the 'peculiar institution'

* In 1850, 3.2 million slaves in the 15 Souther States. 4 million in 1860 (50% of the population)

* In South Carolina, slaves outnumbered whites

* Slavery varied greatly from one state to another. It also depended on the masters. (similar to ‘If only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy. If millions die, that’s only statistics’ - Joseph Stalin)

## American Expansion and the "Manifest Destiny"

Doctrine which stated that westward expansion of the United-States was inevitable and a God-given right. **But, should those new states be free or slave states?**. This religious aspect of the *manifest destiny* is depicted in the *American Progress* by John Gast. This also went hand in hand with the idea that the whites were superior by god's will. Therefore, this helped the spread of slavery. Due to the expansion of territories, the balance between free and slave states was threatened. The Missouri compromise was attempted in 1820, all states underneath the 36 30'N latitude had to be slave states. This didn't work in the long run. In 1850, Stephen Douglas applied California as a free state and compromised to a vote of the people. He was born of an interracial family and expected abolitionists to win, he was wrong. **Popular Sovereignty: the people make the decision**. It would've been impossible to decide for all states because it would've been seen as tyranny and would've destroyed the Union. 

### Bleeding Kansas (in handout)

## Uncle Tom's Cabin

Antislavery novel. Depicted the life of a black slave and his interactions with his masters. It quickly became a best seller. It increased opposition to slavery in the North. Didn't have much impact on the South, they saw it as propaganda from the North and banned the book.

## Dred Scott vs. Sandford (1857)

Dred Scott's master took him to a free state which led Scott to argue that he was free. He went to court and ultimately to the Supreme Court but lost because he wasn't a citizen and therefore didn't have the right to sue. He was considered property and therefore couldn't sue.

## Harriet Tubman and the underground railway

The underground railway: a network of safe-houses for fugitive slaves. Harriet Tubman helped many slaves escape to Canada using the underground railway. She didn't make the railway but used it and then helped use it, she returned to the South 13 times to the South to save her cousins, brothers and family. She was the first American woman to lead a military raid, this raid saved over 700 slaves.

## Abraham Lincoln's election

It led to the secession of southern states (the southern states left the union) because he was anti-slavery on a personal level but as a president he was scared to change the state of slavery in the union as it was a very touchy subject. He was elected without the support of the southern states which made him illegitimate for the South. 

# Compo Correction

Analyse the question to determine the essay plan -> "to what extent was slavery responsible for the American Civil War?". To what extent = don't do a dialectic plan (yes/no) but a thematic plan (explain the factors).

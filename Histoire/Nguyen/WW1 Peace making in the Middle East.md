# World War One and peace making in the Middle East

Genocide: the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.
This includes killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. 
**The term "genocide" was coined in 1944**

## Turkish claims

* **There was no INTENT to destroy the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire.**
* Some Armenians survived
* Some Armenians participated in the war and helped the enemy (i.e. the Russians)
* Armenians deaths though tragic and regrettable the result of the civil war that occurred in Eastern Turkey
* No proof proving the Ottoman government ordered the destruction of the Armenian community

Turkish archives have not been fully opened to researchers, none of these terms exclude the possibility of genocide. 

**The US Senate & House of Representatives have both recognized the Armenian Genocide. However, the US government refused to recognize the Armenian Genocide for a long time, why ?**

There is a NATO base in Turkey that the US depended on, until when they started to withdraw their troops. 

## The Treaty of Sèvres (August 10, 1920)

After the treaty, the Ottoman lands were drastically reduces. They lost Arabia, Antalia and Adana. They lost Medina, Jerusalem and Mecca which was very disturbing for a muslim state.

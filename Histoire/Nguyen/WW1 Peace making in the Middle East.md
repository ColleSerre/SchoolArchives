Genocide: the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.
This includes killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. 
**The term "genocide" was coined in 1944**

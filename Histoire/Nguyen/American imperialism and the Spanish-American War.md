# American imperialism and the Spanish-American War

## What were the motivations leading the United-States to the acquisition of an Empire

This is **contradictory** because the US were born out of an empire and fought themselves out of an empire.

### Imperialism 

Greatest empires: Mongol (on one continent), British (on several continents)

Definition: State policy, practice, or advocacy of extending power and dominion, especially by direct territorial acquisition or by gaining political and economic control of other areas.

Examples of American imperialism:

* Guantanamo bay (in Cuba)

Monroe Doctrine (1823) [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_Monroe#:~:text=La%20doctrine%20de%20Monroe%20a,d%C3%A9but%20du%20XX%20e%20si%C3%A8cle.)

It embodies isolationism (a foreign strategy which consists on focusing on internal affairs and not foreign affairs). Basically “mind your own business” to europeans. This led to South America being considered as the US’s backyard (“America’s Backyard”). This means that South America is under the US’s protection and therefore, europeans have no business in it.

MAIN factors:

* Markets (Economic)
* American Exceptionalism (ideological)
* International competition (political)
* Naval power (military)

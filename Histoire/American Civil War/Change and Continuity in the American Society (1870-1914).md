# Change and Continuity in the American Society (1870-1914) - How did industrialisation affect Americans' lives in the 19th century

## Industrialisation

Process by which a formerly agrarian society turned into an industrial and urban one. Goods were produced in mass quantities thanks to machines in factories and technical innovation. For the first time, people were paid by someone else.

First Industrial Revolution: end of the 18th century - 1830s/1840s started in England

2nd Industrial Revolution: late 19th century - early 20th; urbanisation, development of telecommunication and transport

### The Gilded Age - Mark Twain (1877-c. 1900)

The expression "Gilded Age" is opposed to "Golden Age" which means that the times of the 2nd Industrial Revolution were only good in appearance.

Industrialisation can be compared to the manifest destiny. 

## Urbanisation and Immigration

Industrialisation was a direct consequence of the Civil War because it boosted clothing and weapon manufacturing as well as telegraph and railway (communications). War brought destruction across the South. Buildings, communication systems, the economy, and transportation infrastructure had to be rebuilt. 

## World Exposition of Chicago (1893)

Was attended by millions of people, the point was to show the US's ability to mass produce and innovate. The exposition was held 401 years after Columbus' arrival in the Americas. This was a major theme in the Word Exposition as they made a lake and reproduced some of Columbus' ships. This can also be linked to the manifest destiny as it means that the Americans believed that nothing was achieved by the natives.

The construction of the first skyscrapers in Chicago produced a boom in population in East Coast cities (300k to 1.7M) in 30 years. This demographic growth was mostly supported by immigration which took place in two waves: one that was mostly made of Anglos-Saxons and Irish and the second which introduced Russians, Italians and a small percentage of Asians and Canadians. Two points were crucial to integration: religion and language, asians who didn't have either were largely discriminated against.

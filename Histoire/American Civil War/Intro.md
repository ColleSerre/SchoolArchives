The deadliest conflict in the history of the country
Still a source of controversy
Richmond was the capital of the Confederate states
Robert E. Lee: General for the Confederacy; his statue was removed by Florida but this was protested.
The Charlottesville riots, white suprematists protested against the removal of the statue. Anti-fa protesters protested against these demonstrations. This led to the Charlottesville car attack.

## North vs South

| North                                                                   | South                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Greater population (more soldier + larger labor force)                  | Slaves couldn't be in the army |
| More materials/weapons; better equipment (because of large labor force) |                                |
| Better supply network thanks to greater railroad mileage                |                                |

## The cotton gin

The invention of the cotton gin has allowed greater cotton production which satisfied the increasing demand and increased exports, profits which allowed to buy more fields and increased the need for slaves. 

## Statistics on slavery or the 'peculiar institution'

* In 1850, 3.2 million slaves in the 15 Souther States. 4 million in 1860 (50% of the population)

* In South Carolina, slaves outnumbered whites

* Slavery varied greatly from one state to another. It also depended on the masters. (similar to ‘If only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy. If millions die, that’s only statistics’ - Joseph Stalin)

## American Expansion and the "Manifest Destiny"

Doctrine which stated that westward expansion of the United-States was inevitable and a God-given right. **But, should those new states be free or slave states?**

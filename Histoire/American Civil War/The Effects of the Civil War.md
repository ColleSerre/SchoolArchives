## Essay Question: What were the strengths snd limitations of the Reconstruction

## Dates

**January 1st 1863** - Emancipation Proclamation: All slaves in the rebellious states "shall be then, thenceforward and forever be free"

**December 6th 1865** — 13th Amendment: Abolition of slavery

**1866** - Birth of the KKK. Was originally a social club for Confederate veterans. 

**1868** - The Fourteenth Amendment: those who were enslaved were granted citizenship.

**1870** - The Fifteenth Amendment: Right to vote for **black men**

**1875** - Civil rights Act: Equality of all men in the eyes of the state and law

**Andrew Johnson:**

Was from Tennessee (south) but stayed in the Union. Tried to prevent voting of the 14th Amendment and other resolutions favorable to Black people's rights, was impeached by the House of Representatives

**The KKK:**

Strong christian/religious/conservative values, used the Bible to justify their actions. Many women in later generations of the Klan (1923: Creation of the Women Ku Klux Klan). Italian inspiration

| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----|----|
| Right to vote | Many amendments were done |
| Equality in the eyes of the state and law | Divisive (KKK) |
| Civil rights act, 13th, 14th, 15th | Black codes created disparity in law between north and south + limited the impact of the Amendments |
| Freedmen's Bureau | Death of Lincoln + Andrew Johnson as president |
| | Could be argued that they weren't effective seeing that Jim Crow laws were voted |
| | No education for blacks -> bad jobs |

## How did discrimination develop between black and white citizens after 1877?

### The "Negro Rule" myth & the birth of Segregation

Came with the 15th amendment that gave blacks the right to vote and political power. It's the fear that America would be taken over by blacks. This led to Disenfranchisement, when states try to prevent black people from voting. In 1877, Georgia introduced a $2 poll tax that citizens had to pay to vote. In 1890, Mississippi voters had to pass a literacy test to register to vote, VERY DIFFICULT one wrong answer = failure. Civil rights act was ruled unconstitutional in 1875 which authorised states to pass segregating laws.

### Plessy v Ferguson 1892

This made segregation legal & constitutional. Homer Plessy was jailed for sitting in the "White" car of the East Louisiana Railroad. Argued the 14th Amendment had been violated. 

### Jim Crow laws (see [3ème documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nc3PRW92M2lRcarad2j15Nm3Ab-QHIrLJlUYNasjNwQ/edit)

Interracial marriage was forbidden (link to Nuremberg laws of Nazis?)

Lynching was common in the South (hanging black people by a mob if suspected of committing a crime, **no justice involved**)

## OPLV analysis

Origins, Purpose, Limitations, Value (what can it tell us on its times)

## Andrew Johnson and the 1866 bill

Andrew Johnson (a racist/white supremacist from North Carolina) moved into office when Abraham Lincoln was shot and killed. Therefore, Johnson was not seen as a rightful president. They weren't from the same political side. This increased the shock that was the president's veto on the 1866 bill on the Freedmen's Bureau. Johnson's point was that the bill was too close to being unconstitutional as it infringed on state's rights by allowing the military (under Federal orders) to protect freemen. 

What can we learn?

* High tensions between Congress and President
* Johnson tried to block all improvements for African American's right
* Persistance of high prejudice and racism against African Americans

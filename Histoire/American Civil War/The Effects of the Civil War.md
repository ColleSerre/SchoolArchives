| Strengths | Limitations |
|-----|----|
| Right to vote | Many amendments were done |
| Equality in the eyes of the state and law | Divisive (KKK) |
| Civil rights act, 13th, 14th, 15th | Black codes created disparity in law between north and south + limited the impact of the Amendments |
| Freedmen's Bureau | Death of Lincoln + Andrew Johnson as president |
| | Could be argued that they weren't effective seeing that Jim Crow laws were voted |

## How did discrimination develop between black and white citizens after 1877?

### The "Negro Rule" myth & the birth of Segregation

Came with the 15th amendment that gave blacks the right to vote and political power. It's the fear that America would be taken over by blacks. This led to Disenfranchisement, when states try to prevent black people from voting. In 1877, Georgia introduced a $2 poll tax that citizens had to pay to vote. In 1890, Mississippi voters had to pass a literacy test to register to vote, VERY DIFFICULT one wrong answer = failure. Civil rights act was ruled unconstitutional in 1875 which authorised states to pass segregating laws.

### Plessy v Ferguson 1892

This made segregation legal & constitutional. Homer Plessy was jailed for sitting in the "White" car of the East Louisiana Railroad. Argued the 14th Amendment had been violated.
